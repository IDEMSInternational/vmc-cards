    "statement": "<p>At your friend's birthday there are 8 children. Each child shakes hands with all the others in the party. How many handshakes happened in total? </p>",
    "correct_answer": "28",
    "hint": "<p>Start with a small number of children, e.g. 3,4,5. What is the number of handshakes you have to add if another child joins the party? </p>",
    "explanation": "<p>By counting from small examples, you may realise that each time you add a person at the birthday party with n children, the number of handshakes increases by n.</p>\n<p>If we have 2 children (say A and B) we just have 1 handshake AB. </p>\n<p>When we have 3 children (say A, B and C) we have 3 handshakes: AB, AC and BC. There is the original one and 2 extra ones now that C has joined. 1+2 = 3.  </p>\n<p>If we add another child (say D) they must shake hands with A, B and C and all the other handshakes still take place. So there will be 1+2+3 =6 handshakes</p>\n<p>If we add another child to this group of 4, then there will be another 4 handshakes.So 1+2+3+4=10 handshakes.</p>\n<p>If we follow this pattern we can find the answer for 8 children is 1+2+3+4+5+6+7=28.</p>\n<p>Another way to think about it is if you are one of the 8 children, you need to shake hands with the 7 other people. So does every other child at the party. Since there are 8 of you, and you each shake hands with 7 other people, there should be 8\u22c57 handshakes. <strong>But</strong> this gives us 56 not 28 because we have counted every handshake twice. So the answer is 8\u22c57/2 = 28 </p>"

    "statement": "<p>The whole school came to the birthday party: there are now 100 children! How many handshakes happen?</p>",
    "hint": "<p>Can you find a formula for the number of handshakes when there are n children at the birthday party? Think about the strategy you used to answer the previous question and try to generalise it for any number of children.</p>",
    "correct_answer": "4950",
    "explanation": "<p>Generalising what you found earlier, you can come up with the rule that for a birthday party with n children you have 1+2+...+(n-1) handshakes. Or you might realise that you can use n(n-1)/2 for the number of handshakes. For 100 children there are 100\u22c599/2 = 4950 handshakes. This is the same as adding up the numbers 1 + 2 + 3 + \u2026+ 99.</p>"

  "extension_2": {
    "statement": "<p>A bigger school had a party. There were 28,680 handshakes! How many children were there?</p>",
    "hint": "",
    "correct_answer": "240",
    "explanation": "<p>The formula for the number of handshakes for n children is n(n-1)/2. We need to find the value of n such that n(n-1)/2=28680. Multiplying by two gives us n(n-1)= 57,360. Notice that we roughly want n\u22c5n = 57360 so try taking the square root of 57,360. This gives 239.49947\u2026 So let us try 240. 240\u22c5239/2 = 28680.</p>"

    "about": "<p>This is a classic puzzle that has been around for many years. There are many problem-solving strategies that can be used to find the solution - act it out, draw a diagram, look for a pattern, solve a simpler problem, make an organized list, make a table, use logical reasoning, . . . . The solution has deep mathematical properties and is a key result in the field of combinatorics. The number of handshakes is always a <strong>triangular number. </strong>The first ten triangular numbers are 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55, \u2026</p>",
