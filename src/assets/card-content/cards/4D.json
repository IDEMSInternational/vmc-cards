    "explanation": "<p>There is a choice of 5 colours for the first section. Once a colour has been chosen, the second section cannot be the same. So there are only four colours to choose from for the second section. For the third section, there are four colours to choose from, as it cannot be the same colour as the second one yet it can be the same colour as the first one. Thus, the number of tricolour flags with 5 colours to choose from are 5\u00d74\u00d74 = 80.</p>"
