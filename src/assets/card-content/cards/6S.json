    "about": "<p>This puzzle is an example of a Latin square. Interestingly, if the problem had involved 6 ranks of playing cards it would have been impossible. But with 7 ranks it is quite easy to find a solution. Latin squares are used in medical trials to ensure every participant is allocated to each treatment for the same time period to prove which is the best treatment.</p>",
