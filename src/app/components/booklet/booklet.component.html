<h2> C1 - Knockdown</h2>

<p>Pegs numbered 1 to 50 are placed in order in a line, with number 1 on the left.</p>
<p>They are then knocked over, one at a time, following these two rules:</p>
<p>What is the number of the last peg to be knocked down?</p>

<p><b>Hint: </b> What happens if you only had 5 pegs? What about 10 or 20? Can you spot the pattern?</p>

<p><b>Explanation: </b> Start: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 ...</p>
<p>First round:  ✕ 2 ✕ 4 ✕ 6 ✕ 8 ✕  ... only even numbers left</p>
<p>Second round: ✕ 4 ✕ 8 ✕ 12 ...  only multiples of 4 left</p>
<p>Third round: ✕ 8 ✕ 16 ✕ 24  ...  only multiples of 8 left</p>
<p>Fourth round: Only multiples of 16 will be left</p>
<p>Fifth round: Only multiples of 32 will be left.</p>
<p>32 is the only multiple of 32 under 50, so 32 is the last peg left.</p>

<p><b>About: </b> This puzzle is all about powers of numbers.</p>
<p>This puzzle comes from <a href="https://nrich.maths.org/11677">https://nrich.maths.org/11677</a> and is actually related to binary numbers!</p>

<h3>Extension 1</h3>

<p>Pegs numbered 1 to 1050 are placed in order in a line, with number 1 on the left.</p>
<p>They are then knocked over, one at a time, following these two rules:</p>
<p>What is the number of the last peg to be knocked down?</p>

<p><b>Hint: </b> Can you find the closest power of 2 less than 1050?</p>

<p><b>Explanation: </b> As before, after the first round we have only multiples of 2. The second leaves only multiples of 4, the pattern continues and each subsequent round leaves only multiples of 8, 16, 32, ..., 512, 1024. All of the multiples of 1024 (except 1024 itself) are bigger than 1050, which means 1024 will be the last peg left.</p>

<h3>Extension 2</h3>

<p>Pegs numbered 1 to 10000050 are placed in order in a line, with number 1 on the left.</p>
<p>They are then knocked over, one at a time, following these two rules:</p>
<p>What is the number of the last peg to be knocked down?</p>

<p><b>Hint: </b> Can you find the closest power of 2 less than 1050?</p>

<p><b>Explanation: </b> This puzzle is similar to the previous parts. In those cases, at each round we left the multiples of the increasing powers of 2. The sequence 2, 4, 8, 16,... can be written 2, 2², 2³, 2⁴,... </p>
<p>In the new puzzle we have multiples of powers of 10 left. Indeed, after the first round only multiples of 10 are left. After the second round only multiples of 100 = 10² are left, after the third round only leave multiples of 1000 = 10³, and so on. Thus 10000000 = 10⁷ will be the last peg left, as all other multiples of 10⁷ are larger than 10000050.</p>

<h2> C2 - OneTwoThreeFourFive</h2>

<p>The pattern 123451234512345... is continued to form a 2000 digit number.</p>
<p>What is the sum of all 2000 digits?</p>

<p><b>Hint: </b> How many times does the pattern 12345 appear in the 2000 digit number?</p>

<p><b>Explanation: </b> The five numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 add up to 15. If the pattern is continued for 2000 digits there will be 2000 ∕ 5 = 400 sets of these five numbers. 400×15 = 6000.</p>

<p><b>About: </b> There is a formula for adding the numbers 1, 2, 3, …, n together. It is ½×n×(n + 1). For example 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 28 can be found by  ½×7×8  = 28. </p>
<p>The sequence of numbers that this formula gives are called triangular numbers. The first ten are 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, and 55. </p>

<h3>Extension 1</h3>

<p>The pattern 123456712345671234567... is continued to form a 2100 digit number.</p>
<p>What is the sum of all 2100 digits?</p>

<p><b>Hint: </b> What do the numbers 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 add up to?</p>

<p><b>Explanation: </b> The seven numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 add up to 28. If the pattern is continued for 2100 digits there will be 2100 ∕ 7 = 300 sets of these seven numbers. 300×28 = 8400.</p>

<h3>Extension 2</h3>

<p>The pattern 1234...n,1234,...n,1234…,n is carried on for 120000 digits. If the sum of these digits is 960000, what is n equal to? </p>

<p><b>Hint: </b> What do the numbers 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 add up to?</p>

<p><b>Explanation: </b> 960000 is the sum of all the digits. There are 120000 digits, so dividing 960000 by 120000 gives us the average of the digits. This is 8, so we are looking for a sequence of numbers 1, 2, 3, … with an average of 8. This must be 1, 2, 3, …, 15.</p>

<h2> C3 - Mean</h2>

<p>The average (mean) of 16 different positive integers is 16. What is the greatest possible value that any of these integers could have?</p>

<p><b>Hint: </b> Make the first 15 (different) numbers as small as possible. What does this tell us about the 16th number?</p>

<p><b>Explanation: </b> If the mean of 16 numbers is 16, then the total of all the numbers is 16×16 = 256. We want to make one of the numbers as big as possible, so we should make the other 15 numbers as small as possible. The integers have to be different so we should choose 1, 2, 3, ..., 15. If you add them up this gives 120 (a quick way to do it is ½×15×16 = 120). So the biggest number is 256 - 120 = 136.</p>

<p><b>About: </b> The mean is one way of describing a whole set of data with just one number. The median is another way describing the set of data with one number. If the puzzle had asked "The median of 16 different positive integers is 16. What is the greatest possible value that any of these integers could have?", then there would be no solution as you could choose any number as large as you like for the biggest number, as the value of the median of 16 numbers depends only on the eight and ninth biggest numbers! </p>

<h3>Extension 1</h3>

<p>The average (mean) age of 7 people is 16. Given that all their ages are different positive integers, what is the maximum number of people that could be older than 16?</p>

<p><b>Hint: </b> Could everyone be older than 16? If not, can you try and find the maximum number of people that could be older than 16 if just one of the people is as young as possible?</p>

<p><b>Explanation: </b> You cannot make all 7 people older than 16 because the average is 16. You could start with the youngest person being 1, and try to make the other 6 people older than 16 but the total must be 7×16 = 112. With this strategy, 112 - 1 = 111 and 16 + 17 + 18 + 19 + 20 + 21 = 111 so this only gives 5 people older than 16 as you can't count 16 itself. This shows that you cannot do it with 6 people older than 16, but because you have a possibility with 5, this is the largest number you can have. </p>

<h3>Extension 2</h3>

<p>When Albert entered the room, the average age increased by 4 years. When Belinda then entered the room, the average age increased by another 3 years. Albert and Belinda are twins. How many people were in the room before Albert entered?</p>

<p><b>Hint: </b> Could everyone be older than 16? If not, can you try and find the maximum number of people that could be older than 16 if just one of the people is as young as possible?</p>

<p><b>Explanation: </b> There are different ways to solve this puzzle. For each method let n be the number of people in the room.</p>
<p>If Albert and Belinda walked in together, between them they would have added (n + 2)×7 onto the total of all the ages in the room. If just Albert walked in, then he would have added (n + 1)×4 to the total. It is the same for Belinda, so if they both walked in together it would be double this amount. So  (n + 2)×7 = 2×(n + 1)×4. Solving this gives n = 6.</p>
<p>Alternatively, let a be Albert and Belinda's age. The new mean after Albert walks in is (a - 4×n) because Albert has shared out 4 years to everyone in the room to make his age the same. After Belinda walks in the mean is (a - 3×(n + 1)) because she has given 3 years to everyone in the room including Albert. We know that this second expression must be 3 more than the first expression as the mean increased by 3 when Belinda walked in. So we can solve (a - 3×(n + 1)) = a - 4×n + 3  which gives n = 6.</p>
<p>Here is another way. Let the original mean be m. The sum of all the ages is originally (m×n). Let Albert's age be a. When Albert walks in, the new mean is (m + 4). This must be equal to (m×n + a) ∕ (n + 1). When Belinda walks in the room, the new mean is (m + 7). This must be equal to (m×n + 2×a) ∕ (n + 2). Rearranging these equations gives </p>
<p>m×n + a = m×n + m + 4×n + 4</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>m×n + 2×a = m×n + 2×m + 7×n + 14</p>
<p>Which simplify to</p>
<p>a = m + 4×n + 4 and 2×a = 2×m + 7×n + 14. </p>
<p>Multiplying the first equation by 2 and subtracting the second one gives n = 6. So there are 6 people in the room at the start. </p>

<h2> C4 - House</h2>

<p>From how many vertices (points) is it possible to draw this figure by an uninterrupted movement of the pen, going through each line exactly once?</p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/House_image_0.png" class="House_image_0" /></p>

<p><b>Hint: </b> Try starting from the bottom left vertex (point).</p>

<p><b>Explanation: </b> We can draw the figure in one uninterrupted movement if we start at the bottom left or bottom right vertex. For example starting at the bottom left:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/House_image_1.png" class="House_image_1" /></p>
<p>This kind of path is called an Euler path, and it is called an Euler circuit if it starts and ends in the same point. The degree of a vertex is the number of edges joining onto that vertex, and vertices are said to be odd or even according to whether the degree is odd or even. Euler circuits exist only in networks where there are no odd vertices, that is where all the vertices have an even number of edges ending there.</p>
<p>Two edges are used each time the path visits and leaves a vertex because the circuit must use each edge only once. It follows that if the graph has an odd vertex then that vertex must be the start or end of the path and, as a circuit starts and ends at the same vertex, for a circuit to exist all the vertices must be even. When there are two odd vertices a walk can take place that traverses each edge exactly once but this will not be a circuit.</p>
<p>Can you think why it is impossible to draw any graph with an odd number of odd vertices (e.g. one odd vertex)? Well the reason is that each edge has two ends so the total number of endings is even, so the sum of the degrees of all the vertices in a graph must be even, so there cannot be an odd number of odd vertices.</p>

<p><b>About: </b> A version of this problem was originally solved by Leonard Euler. In a city consisting of 4 islands linked by bridges, he wondered if it is possible to go for a walk and cross each bridge exactly once. If you draw a vertex for each island, and a line between two vertices for each bridge, you get a drawing like in this puzzle.</p>

<p>From how many vertices (points) is it possible to draw this figure by an uninterrupted movement of the pen, going through each line exactly once?</p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/House_image_2.png" class="House_image_2" /></p>

<p><b>Hint: </b> Start with the top vertex. Once you have followed each line, where do you end up? Can you make use of this information to find out where else you could start?</p>

<p><b>Explanation: </b> If you start with the point at the top, you will notice that after following all the lines, you end up at the start again. But this means you went in a loop! So you can start anywhere along this loop and simply follow the lines the same way you did before, and you will end up where you started. This means you can start from any of the vertices and visit all lines. </p>

<h2> C5 - Honey Bees</h2>

<p>One gallon of honey provides fuel for one bee to fly about seven million miles.</p>
<p>Roughly how many bees could fly one thousand miles if they had ten gallons of honey?</p>

<p><b>Hint: </b> How far can one bee travel with ten gallons of honey?</p>

<p><b>Explanation: </b> 10 gallons would allow one bee to travel for 70 million miles. 70000000 ∕ 1000 = 70000 so 70000 bees could travel 1000 miles each.</p>

<p><b>About: </b> Problems such as "if A people can dig a trench in B<strong> </strong>days. How long will it take C<strong> </strong>people to dig the trench?" can be solved by calculating (A×B  ∕ C). This ancient technique is called "the rule of three" and was written about in a nursery rhyme in 1570: <strong> "</strong>Multiplication is vexation;</p>
<p>Division is as bad; The Rule of Three doth puzzle me, And Practice drives me mad."</p>

<h3>Extension 1</h3>

<p>Now suppose 4 bees can each travel 6 million miles on 2 gallons of honey. How far could 8 bees each travel with 6 gallons of honey?</p>

<p><b>Hint: </b> How far can one bee can travel on 1 gallon of honey?</p>

<p><b>Explanation: </b> ½×6000000×4 = 12000000. This is the number of miles one bee can travel on 1 gallon of honey. To find the answer, you can multiply this by 6 to find the total number of miles one bee can travel on 6 gallons of honey and then divide by 8 to find the distance per bee. The answer is 12000000×6 ∕ 8 = 9000000.</p>

<h3>Extension 2</h3>

<p>A worker bee can make a hive of hexagons in 60 minutes, and a queen bee can make the same size hive in 40 minutes. How many minutes will it take them if they do it together?</p>

<p><b>Hint: </b> How far can one bee can travel on 1 gallon of honey?</p>

<p><b>Explanation: </b> We can see this with an example with numbers. If there are 120 hexagons, then the worker bee makes 2 per minute and the queen bee makes 3 per minute. So together they make 5 per minute. 120 ∕ 5 = 24 . It doesn't matter what number of hexagons we start with.</p>
<p>This can also be considered algebraically. Take the total amount of hexagons as h. The worker bee will be working at a rate of (h  ∕ 60) hexagons per minute, and the queen bee at a rate of (h  ∕ 40) per minute. By simply adding the rates together, </p>
<p>(h  ∕ 60) + (h  ∕ 40) = 100×h  ∕ 2400 = h ∕ 24, we can find the answer, 24 minutes.</p>

<h2> C6 - Alphanumerics</h2>

<p>In the sum CAR + CAT = RARE each letter represents a different digit from 0 to 9. What is the value of the word RARE?</p>

<p><b>Hint: </b> What digit must the letter R represent? If you add two 3-digit numbers together, what is the largest sum you could make?</p>

<p><b>Explanation: </b> R must be equal to 1 since only the digit 1 can carry over from the hundreds column into the thousands column. So we now have CA1 + CAT = 1A1E.</p>
<p>If we look at the tens column we have A + A = 1 (or ends in 1). Since A + A is even, the only way for it to end in the digit 1 is for there to be a carry over from the ones column. </p>
<p>This gives us A = 5. We now have C51 + C5T = 151E</p>
<p>Since we know there was a carry over from the ones column, T = 9 and hence E = 0. Therefore the word RARE = 1510. (Though not needed, it can be verified that C = 7). Finally we have 751 + 759 = 1510.</p>

<p><b>About: </b> These types of puzzles are called 'Cryptarithms' or 'Verbal Arithmetic'. The most classic example was published in the July 1924 issue of Strand Magazine by English mathematician Henry Dudeney.  </p>

<h3>Extension 1</h3>

<p>In the sum TWO + TWO = FOUR each letter represents a different digit from 0 to 9. There are 7 different solutions to this sum. For these 7 solutions, what is the largest value of the word FOUR? </p>

<p><b>Hint: </b> Once you figured out what digit F represents, you then want to consider what the largest possible value of O could be.</p>

<p><b>Explanation: </b> F must be equal to 1 since only the digit 1 can carry over from the hundreds column.</p>
<p>We now have TWO + TWO = 1OUR.</p>
<p>As we are trying to find the largest possible value of FOUR, we next try O = 9. Which would give TW9 + TW9 = 19UR. Then the only possibility is T = 9 but this is not possible since O = 9, making O = T.</p>
<p>We next try O = 8. So TW8 + TW8 = 18UR. Which leads to R = 6 and T = 9.  And we then have 9W8 + 9W8 = 18U6.</p>
<p>We still have a choice of answers for W and U.</p>
<p>We require W to be less than 5 to avoid carrying over into the hundreds column. If we tried W = 4, this would lead to U = 9 but this is not possible a T = 9. So we try W = 3.</p>
<p>We end up with  938 + 938 = 1876, and so the largest possible value of the word FOUR is 1876.</p>

<h3>Extension 2</h3>

<p>In the sum MATHS + GAMES = DECODE each letter represents a different digit from 0 to 9. What is the value of the word DECODE?</p>

<p><b>Hint: </b> Once you figured out what digit F represents, you then want to consider what the largest possible value of O could be.</p>

<p><b>Explanation: </b> There are many ways to solve this puzzle. First D = 1. To continue, we must use all the given information to eliminate possibilities. For example, we observe that E must be an even digit. S cannot be equal to 0 or 1 or 5. A lot of brute force is required to work through this problem, but with a table to organise all of the information, you should be able to whittle down the possible solutions until you have reached the correct answer. T = 0, D = 1, A = 2, S = 3, C = 4, H = 5, E = 6, M = 7, O = 8, G = 9.</p>

<h2> C7 - Newspaper</h2>

<p>Below is a single sheet from a newspaper. Given that each sheet has four pages, how many sheets are there altogether?</p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/Newspaper_image_0.png" class="Newspaper_image_0" /></p>

<p><b>Hint: </b> Can you work backwards from 8 to work out how many sheets would be underneath this one? You might want to use bits of paper and number them to help.</p>

<p><b>Explanation: </b> On the back of the number 8 there must be the number 7. The sheet below must have the numbers 6 and 5. Keeping going there will be 4 and 3 and finally 2 and 1. So there are three sheets underneath. Adding on 7 to the 61 gives the last page as 68. Given each sheet has four pages, there are 68 ∕ 4 = 17 sheets.</p>

<p><b>About: </b> You can try this puzzle with a real newspaper - take out one of the sheets and look at the numbers on it. Work out how many sheets there should be and then see if you are correct. </p>

<h3>Extension 1</h3>

<p>If it takes 852 digits to number all the pages of a book, in the usual order, what is the number on the last page of the book?</p>

<p><b>Hint: </b> How many 1 digit numbers are there? How many 2 digit numbers?</p>

<p><b>Explanation: </b> There are 9 one-digit numbers (the numbers 1 - 9), 90 two-digit numbers (the numbers 10 - 99) and 900 three-digits numbers (the numbers 100 - 999). Altogether this would make 9×1 + 90×2 + 900×3 = 9 + 180 + 2700 - 2899 digits, so the number of pages is less than 999. There are 852 - 9 - 180 = 663 digits used in three digit numbers. 663 ∕ 3 = 221, so there are 221 three digit numbers. 99 + 221 = 320 gives us the answer.  </p>

<h3>Extension 2</h3>

<p>Numbering the pages of a book requires printing 123 nines. What is the minimum number of pages the book could have?</p>

<p><b>Hint: </b> How many 1 digit numbers are there? How many 2 digit numbers?</p>

<p><b>Explanation: </b> Think about the numbers under 1000 first. The following numbers have 9s in them: 9, 19, 29, ...99, 109, 119, 129, …, 199, 209, 219, …, 999. One-digit numbers: 1 nine, two-digit numbers: 10 nines (remember to count both in the number 99!), three-digit numbers: 110 nines (10 for each of the 10 sets of three-digit numbers and 10 for the ones that start with a 9). This gives 1 + 10 + 110 = 121. We want to use two more nines, so we can need 1009 and 1019. The minimum number of pages is therefore 1019.</p>

<h2> C8 - Sword of Josephus</h2>

<p>Pegs numbered 1 to 52 are placed in a circle. Starting with number 2, alternate pegs are knocked down until only one is left.</p>
<p>What is the number of the last peg to be knocked down?</p>

<p><b>Hint: </b> What happens if you only had 2 pegs? What about 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 pegs? Can you spot the pattern after considering these cases?</p>

<p><b>Explanation: </b> Starting with only 2 pegs, we know that the last peg to be knocked down would be number 1. We can work out which would be the last peg if we increase the number to start with, record our results and look for a pattern.</p>
<p>2 - 1</p>
<p>3 - 3</p>
<p>4 - 1</p>
<p>5 - 3</p>
<p>6 - 5</p>
<p>7 - 7</p>
<p>8 - 1</p>
<p>9 - 3</p>
<p>And so on. Each power of two (1, 2, 4, 8, …) "resets" the last peg standing to be number 1. You can see that the numbers go up in odd numbers after this. To work out for 52, we know the last reset was the largest power of two below it is 32, and 52 - 32 = 20. So it is the twentieth odd number that is calculated as 2×20 + 1 = 41.  </p>

<p><b>Explanation: </b> The biggest power of 2 below 2000 is 1024. As 2000 - 1024 = 976, the final peg will be the 976ᵗʰ odd number, 976×2 + 1 = 1953.</p>

<h2> C9 - Restaurant</h2>

<p>At a restaurant each table has 3 legs, each chair has 4 legs and all the customers and the three members of staff have 2 legs each. There are four chairs at each table. Three quarters of the chairs are occupied by customers and there are 206 legs altogether in the restaurant. How many chairs does the restaurant have?</p>

<p><b>Hint: </b> Can you work out how many legs there are at each table if three quarters of the chairs have people on them?</p>

<p><b>Explanation: </b> The three members of staff have six legs so take this off the total, giving 206 - 6 = 200. Now the tables, chairs and customers have 200 legs. On average, at each table there are 3 table legs, 16 chair legs and 6 customer legs (as only three quarters of the chairs are taken).This gives 3 + 16 + 6 = 25 legs per table. The number of tables is therefore 200 ∕ 25 = 8, hence the number of chairs is 8×4 = 32. </p>

<p><b>About: </b> This puzzle was originally a problem from a UKMT maths challenge  </p>

<h3>Extension 1</h3>

<p>I have 30 coins. Some of the coins are 1¢, some are 2¢ and some are 6¢. The value of the 6¢ coins is worth the same amount as the total value of the 1¢ coins and the 2¢ coins combined. Given that I have a different amount of each type of coin, what is the total value of all of the coins (in ¢)?</p>

<p><b>Hint: </b> Start by considering how many 6¢ coins I could have...if I have too many, I won't be able to match their value with the 1¢ coins and the 2¢ coins.</p>

<p><b>Explanation: </b> First we suppose we have 8×6¢ coins, this has a value of 48¢, with 22 coins remaining. The target value is always a multiple of six and therefore even, so we will require an even number of 1¢ to make the even number. The largest even total among the rest of the coins is 20x2¢ + 2x1¢  = 42¢, which is less than 48¢.</p>
<p>So at most we can have 7×6¢ = 42¢, with 23 coins remaining. In this case we have the largest even total is  21x2¢ + 2x1¢  = 44¢. Our target was 42¢, thus we include more 1¢ coins, and fewer 2¢ coins. The next highest even total with 19x2¢ + 4x1¢  = 42¢, hitting our target.</p>
<p>Therefore the total value of all coins 7×6¢ + 19x2¢ + 4x1¢ = 84¢.</p>
<p>For completeness, the smallest number of 6¢ coins is 5 (choosing 4 gives a total of  24¢ with 26 coins remaining). The solution with 5×6¢ is 5×2¢ and 10×1¢. The solution for 6×6¢ is 12×2¢ and 12×1¢. However neither of these solutions have a different amount of each coin.</p>

<p><b>Explanation: </b> If we call the two distances "short" and "long", then any such drawing of points must have a triangle with one long and two short edges (it's not quite obvious, but if you think about it a bit you can eliminate all other possibilities). Now where does the last point go? To each of the other 3 points, it's connected either via a long or a short edge, giving 8 possibilities. Try out each of them, you will notice that 2 of them do not work out, leaving 6 solutions.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/Two_Distances_image_1.png" class="Two_Distances_image_1" /></p>
<p>Short edges represented by <strong>blue</strong> while long edges represented by <strong>green</strong>. One of these solutions can be extended to 5 points that only use two distances, see bottom right picture.</p>

<p><b>About: </b> Alex Bellos featured this puzzle in his column in the Guardian newspaper in the UK after hearing about it from maths juggler Colin Wright, who heard it from puzzle maven Peter Winkler.</p>

<h3>Extension 1</h3>

<p>In how many different ways can you draw 4 points in the plane whose pairwise distances are √2, √2, 2, √10, √10 and 4?</p>

<p><b>Hint: </b> Try to figure out what kind of triangles you can make that use 3 of the 6 distances. If you have squared paper, it helps that it is possible to put all the vertices on the grid.</p>

<p><b>Explanation: </b> This set of distances is quite special! For most sets of pairwise distances, there is only one solution, but here there are two.</p>

<h2> CJ - Dealing Cards</h2>

<p>Children are sitting in a circle, and a teacher walks around the circle, dealing cards. The teacher gives a Jack to every second child, and a Queen to every third child.</p>
<p>After going around four times, the sixth child from where the teacher started has two Jacks and two Queens.</p>
<p>What is the smallest number of children could there be?</p>

<p><b>Hint: </b> Must there be an even or an odd number of children in the circle?</p>

<p><b>Explanation: </b> The teacher goes round the circle four times. If there was an even number of children, the sixth child would always receive a Jack each time and would have four Jacks by the end. Since they only have two Jacks, there must be an odd number of children in the circle.</p>
<p>The sixth child receives a Queen in the first round because 6 is a multiple of 3. She only receives one more Queen so the answer can't be a multiple of 3.</p>
<p>The options are 7, 11, 13, 17, 19 … and so 7 is the fewest number of children. </p>

<p><b>About: </b> This puzzle was written by a student at the Lycee Francais Charles de Gaulle for a Christmas puzzle involving handing out red and blue presents.</p>

<h3>Extension 1</h3>

<p>Children are sitting in a circle, and a teacher walks around the circle, dealing cards. The teacher gives a Jack to every second child, a Queen to every third child and a King to every fifth child. </p>
<p>After going around four times, the sixth child from where the teacher started has four Jacks, two Queens and no Kings.</p>
<p>What is the fewest amount of children could there be?</p>

<p><b>Hint: </b> Think about whether the number needs to be odd or even and if it needs to be divisible by 3 or 5.</p>

<p><b>Explanation: </b> The child receives four Jacks so there must be an even number of children, but only receives two queens so the number of children cannot be a multiple of 3. As the child receives no Kings, 6 and 10 would both be options (try these out with cards or on pen and paper to check). But 6 is a multiple of 3 so the answer must be 10. </p>

<h3>Extension 2</h3>

<p>1000 students are sitting in a circle, and a teacher walks around the circle, dealing cards. The teacher gives a Jack to every second child, and a Queen to every third child</p>
<p>After the teacher goes around 1000 times, how many cards in total will the sixth child have?</p>

<p><b>Hint: </b> Think about whether the number needs to be odd or even and if it needs to be divisible by 3 or 5.</p>

<p><b>Explanation: </b> There are an even number of children so the sixth child will always be in a position on each turn to receive Jack. So she will have 1000 cards from that rule. For the Queens in the first round the students to receive one will be in position 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, …, 999, then it will be 2, 5, 8, …, 998 and then 1,4,7, ..., 997, 1000, and back to 3, 6, 9, …, 999.  So every third time she will get a Queen. Because 1000 ∕ 3 is 333 with a remainder of 1, she will get one on the 1000ᵗʰ turn too. So 1000 + 334 = 1334 is the total number of cards.  </p>

<h2> CQ - Lost cards</h2>

<p>A small number of cards has been lost from a complete pack of 52. If I deal among four people, three cards remain. If I deal among three people, two remain and if I deal among five people, two cards remain. How many cards are there?</p>

<p><b>Hint: </b> Think about remainders when dividing. If there are two left when divided amongst five people then the number must be two more than a multiple of 5, e.g. 7 or 32</p>

<p><b>Explanation: </b> As only a small number of cards have been lost, let us start by listing the numbers that work that are close to 52.</p>
<p>If there were no cards remaining when dealt between four people we would know that the number of cards was in the four times table, i.e …, 36, 40, 44, 48. But there are three left over, so the number of cards must be in the sequence …, 39, 43, 47, 51.</p>
<p>For dealing among three people with two left over we get the sequence …, 41,44,47,50</p>
<p>For dealing among five people with two left over we get the sequence …,32, 37,42,47</p>
<p>The number that appears on all three lists is 47.</p>
<p>We could also solve the puzzle starting with the last two clues. There is the same number of cards leftover when dealing to three or five people, so the answer must be two more than a multiple of 15, so 17, 32 or 47. The only one of these numbers that fits with the first clue is 47.</p>

<p><b>About: </b> There is a special name for the operation of dividing by a number and finding the remainder in mathematics - it is called <strong>mod</strong>ular arithmetic. 47 mod 5 = 2 because when you divide 47 by 5 you have a remainder of 2. It is a powerful technique in mathematics to prove facts about numbers. We use it in everyday life when we tell the time with a 24 hour clock. </p>
<p>(18 + 8) mod 24 = 2 or in other words 8 hours after 6pm is 2am! </p>

<h3>Extension 1</h3>

<p>Some cards have been lost from a complete pack of 52. If I deal among three or four people there are always two cards remaining. How many different options are there for the number of cards remaining?</p>

<p><b>Hint: </b> Think about multiples of 12.</p>

<p><b>Explanation: </b> There must be two more than a multiple of 12, because there are two more than a multiple of 3 and two more than a multiple of 4. So there are four numbers … namely 14, 26, 38, 50.</p>

<h3>Extension 2</h3>

<p>Some cards have been lost from a complete pack of 52. If I deal among two people there is one card remaining, and if I deal among four people there are two cards remaining. How many different options are there for the number of cards remaining?</p>

<p><b>Hint: </b> Think about multiples of 12.</p>

<p><b>Explanation: </b> There are 0 options because it is impossible to have a number that is both one more than a multiple of 2 (must be odd) and two more than a multiple of 4 (must be even).</p>

<h2> CK - Monkey business</h2>

<p>A large room has 1000 light bulbs in it, all are switched off. 1000 monkeys enter the room and decide to press the light switches in a very particular way.</p>
<p>The 1<sup>st</sup> monkey presses every multiple of 1.</p>
<p>The 2<sup>nd</sup> monkey presses every multiple of 2.</p>
<p>The 3<sup>rd</sup> monkey presses every multiple of 3.</p>
<p>Etc., until the 1000<sup>th</sup> monkey. After all the monkeys have finished pressing switches, how many lights in total will be on?</p>

<p><b>Hint: </b> Can you work out whether number 8 will be on or off? How about number 9? What is it about the factors of these two numbers that means one of them is on and one of them is off?</p>

<p><b>Explanation: </b> Most numbers will be pressed by an even number of monkeys, e.g. 24 has factors (1×24, 2×12, 3×8, 4×6), so monkeys 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24 will press the switch, and as this is an even number the light will be off.</p>
<p>Square numbers are the only ones which do not have an even number of factors, e.g. 16 has factors (1×16, 2×8, 4×4). Monkeys 1, 2, 4, 8, 16 will press the switch, and as this is an odd number the light will stay on (monkey 4 won't press it twice!).</p>
<p>So we just need to work out how many square numbers there are between 1 and 1000. </p>
<p>We find the largest square number less than 1000: 31×31 = 961, 32×32 = 1024</p>
<p>So there will be 31 switches left on! (switch numbers 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, … , 900, 961)</p>

<p><b>About: </b> This is a very famous puzzle that can be found in different contexts - opening and closing lockers is another common one. It is designed to make you think about the properties of different numbers. </p>

<h3>Extension 1</h3>

<p>How many lights switches will be touched by exactly three monkeys?</p>

<p><b>Hint: </b> Light switch number 9 will be touched by three monkeys - 1,3, and 9, can you find other numbers that will?</p>

<p><b>Explanation: </b> The lockers which are touched by only three monkeys are the squares of prime numbers (because these are the only numbers which have exactly three factors.) The numbers are 4,9, 25, 49, 121, 169, 289, 361, 529, 841 and 961 which is 11 in total.</p>

<h3>Extension 2</h3>

<p>Which light bulb will be touched by the most monkeys?</p>

<p><b>Hint: </b> Light switch number 9 will be touched by three monkeys - 1,3, and 9, can you find other numbers that will?</p>

<p><b>Explanation: </b> A number will have the most number of factors if its prime factor decomposition has the most numbers in it. For example 24 = 2³×3 has 8 factors (1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24) compared to 25 = 5² which only has 3 (1, 5, 25). </p>
<p>To find the number less than 1000 that has the most factors, we start as many of the smallest primes as we can then multiply to less than 1000 (2×3×5×7) and then we can multiply by 2 until the number is as close to 1000 as possible.</p>
<p>Therefore, the answer is 2³×3×5×7 = 840.</p>
<p>The number of factors of 840 is 32, so light switch 840 has been touched by 32 monkeys.</p>

<h2> D1 - Table Handshakes</h2>

<p>If 8 people are seated around a circular table, in how many ways can all of them be simultaneously shaking hands with another person at the table in such a way that none of the arms cross each other? (They have very long arms).</p>

<p><b>Hint: </b> What is the answer if there are just 2 people, or 4 people, or 6 people. Can you find a way of making the cases with fewer people help you count the cases with more people?</p>

<p><b>Explanation: </b> For the case with 2 people there is just 1 way: </p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/Table_Handshakes_image_0.png" class="Table_Handshakes_image_0" /></p>
<p>For 4 people there are 2 ways:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/Table_Handshakes_image_1.png" class="Table_Handshakes_image_1" /><img alt="" src="images/Table_Handshakes_image_2.png" class="Table_Handshakes_image_2" /></p>
<p>For 6 people, we can consider the options for who number 1 shakes hands with. Number 1 cannot shake hands with number 3 or 5 as that would leave someone cut off from the group. If number 1 shakes hands with number 2 like this:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/Table_Handshakes_image_3.png" class="Table_Handshakes_image_3" /></p>
<p>Then we know that the other four people can shake hands in 2 different ways (using our result from before). Number 1 could shake hands with number 6 and there would also be 2 different ways for the other four to shake hands. Finally number 1 could shake hands with number 4, and that would just leave one option:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/Table_Handshakes_image_4.png" class="Table_Handshakes_image_4" /></p>
<p>So the result for 6 people is: 5 = 2 + 1 + 2.</p>
<p>For eight people number 1 could shake hands with number 2 (leaving a group of 6 people which we now know there are 5 ways to shake hands), number 4 (leaving a group of 4, so 2 ways) number 6 (leaving a group of 4, so 2 ways) or number 6 (leaving a group of 6 so 5 ways). So the answer for eight people is 5 + 2 + 2 + 5.</p>

<p><b>About: </b> The sequence of numbers we have discovered 1, 2, 5, 14, 42, ... are called <em>Catalan numbers</em> and they are crucial in the world of combinatorics. There is evidence of their use in China as far back as 1730, but they are named after the Belgian mathematician Eugène Charles Catalan (1814–1894).</p>

<h3>Extension 1</h3>

<p>What if we have 10 people at the table? It may be useful to use previous results to help you!</p>

<p><b>Hint: </b> Counting explicitly might be too long. Can you come up with a way to reduce the problem in simpler cases you have already counted? Focus on when a fixed person shakes hands with another one: the problem splits into a left part and a right part where a lower number of people have to shake their hands.</p>

<p><b>Explanation: </b> Let us number people from 1 to 10 counter-clockwise. Let us focus our attention on a fixed person, say person 1. When person 1 shakes hands with person number 2 there are 10 - 2 = 8 people on their left that have to shake hands. For them this is the problem we had before, with 8 people at the table they can shake hands in 14 different ways. Now imagine person 1 wants to shake hands with person 3: this would leave person 2 alone, since every attempt of the latter to shake hands with others would cross the handshaking of people 1 and 3. Therefore person 1 has to skip person 3 and shake hands with person 4. On their right they have people 2 and 3 who can only shake hands themselves in one way, whereas on their left they have 10 - 2 - 2 = 6 people who can shake hands in 5 ways (as calculated before), therefore we have 1×5 = 5 possibility in this case. Let us now consider people 1 and 5: there will be a person among people 2, 3, 4 who will remain alone, therefore person 1 has to move to person 6. In this case we will have 4 people on the right (people 2, 3, 4, 5) and four people on the left (people 7, 8, 9, 10). Each group can independently shake hands in 2 ways, therefore the total is 2×2 = 4. We continue with person 1 shaking hands with person 8 (obtaining 1×5 = 5 ways) and then with person 10 (obtaining 14 ways). We have exhausted all possible ways person 1 can shake hands, therefore above we have covered all possible cases, which add up to: 14 + 1×5 + 2×2 + 5×1 + 14 = 42.</p>
<p>Thinking about the problem in this way leads to a formula to calculate the number of handshakes Hₙ where n is the (even) number of people at the table:</p>
<p>Hₙ = Hₙ₋₂ + H₂×Hₙ₋₄ + H₄×Hₙ₋₆ + … + Hₙ₋₄×H₂ + Hₙ₋₂</p>
<p>For example, for 10 people at the table:</p>
<p>H₁₀ = H₈ + H₂×H₆+ H₄×H₄ + H₆×H₂ + H₈ = 14 + 1×5 + 2×2 + 5×1 + 14 = 42</p>

<h3>Extension 2</h3>

<p>What if we have 14 people at the table? Can you use previous results to calculate the number of ways they can shake hands? </p>

<p><b>Hint: </b> Counting explicitly might be too long. Can you come up with a way to reduce the problem in simpler cases you have already counted? Focus on when a fixed person shakes hands with another one: the problem splits into a left part and a right part where a lower number of people have to shake their hands.</p>

<p><b>Explanation: </b> Let Hₙ be the number of ways n people shake hands. In the previous solutions we have calculated the numbers H₂, H₄,  H₆, H₈, and H₁₀. We know the formula for 14 people requires us to calculate for 12 people first. We therefore calculate</p>
<p>H₁₂ = H₁₀ + H₂×H₈ + … + H₈×H₂ + H₁₀ = 132</p>
<p>And likewise we can then calculate H₁₄ = 429.</p>

<h2> D2 - Triangular Slices</h2>

<p>Consider the cake below – a six-sided hexagon. Now split it into triangles by cutting along diagonals which can only meet at the vertices, one example is given in red. This splitting into triangles is called a triangulation, in how many ways can you do this?</p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/Triangular_Slices_image_0.png" class="Triangular_Slices_image_0" /></p>

<p><b>Hint: </b> In how many ways could you do it if the cake were a square? What if it were a five-sided pentagon? Can you use the symmetries of your cake to count faster?</p>

<p><b>Explanation: </b> It is best to start with a simpler question and look for patterns. Start by looking at a square. There are two different ways we could slice the cake. </p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/Triangular_Slices_image_1.png" class="Triangular_Slices_image_1" /></p>
<p>For a pentagon there are five ways:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/Triangular_Slices_image_2.png" class="Triangular_Slices_image_2" /></p>
<p>For a hexagon there are 14 ways as you can see below:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/Triangular_Slices_image_3.png" class="Triangular_Slices_image_3" /></p>
<p>In this diagram you can see the solution is found by thinking of 6 + 3 + 2 + 3 = 14, but you can arrive at the solution by doing 5 + 2 + 2 + 5 = 14 where 5 is the answer for a pentagon and 2 is the answer for a square. The equivalent combination for the pentagon is 2 + 1 + 2 = 5, where 1 is the result of the triangle (which has of course only one option) and 2 is the result for a square.</p>
<p>This is a more useful technique for moving on to thinking of polygons with more vertices.</p>

<p><b>About: </b> These Cₙ are called <em>Catalan numbers</em> and they are crucial in the world of combinatorics. There is an explicit formula for them, but finding it goes much beyond our scopes: the above recursive definition is more than enough for now! Interestingly there are many different puzzles that lead to these numbers (more than 200!) … perhaps you have seen another puzzle with the same answers?</p>

<h3>Extension 1</h3>

<p>Can you find the answer to the same question if the cake has the shape of a seven-sided heptagon? </p>

<p><b>Hint: </b> Can you reuse previous results to compute this number? Counting explicitly might be too long. Can you come up with a way to reduce the problem in simpler cases you have already counted? Focus on when a fixed edge of the heptagon is present in a certain triangle. The heptagon is then split into two parts, the one at the left of the above triangle and the one at the right. Both parts are smaller...</p>

<p><b>Explanation: </b> Let us number the vertices of the heptagon from 1 to 7 counter-clockwise. Let us focus our attention on a fixed edge, say the one with vertices 1 and 2. When the edge is present in the triangle with the extra vertex 3, then the heptagon is split in that triangle and the hexagon at its left (with vertices 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7). For the latter, the problem is the exact same you solved before, e.g. you get 14 ways of triangulating it. Then consider when the fixed edge forms a triangle with vertex 4. At the right of that triangle you have one triangle (with vertices 2, 3, and 4), whereas at the left you have a pentagon (with vertices 1, 4, 5, 6, and 7) for which we know you can do 5 triangulations. Therefore, this case provides you with 5×1 = 5 triangulations.
Let us consider the case when the fixed edge forms a triangle with a vertex 5. Both at the right of that triangle and at the left you have one square: one with vertices 2, 3, 4, and 5, and the other with vertices 1, 5, 6, and 7. Each square can be independently triangulated in 2 ways, therefore, this case provides you with 2×2 = 4 triangulations.
We continue with the fixed edge forming a triangle with vertices 6 and then 7.
We have exhausted all possible ways the fixed edge can appear in a triangulation. Moreover in every possible triangulation every edge has to be part of a triangle. Therefore above we have covered all possible cases, which are adding up: 14 + 1×5 + 2×2 + 5×1 + 14 = 42.</p>
<p>We can find a formula for the number Cₙ of triangulations of the (n + 2)-gon. Generalising what we did before we have that:
Cₙ = Cₙ₋₁ + C₁×Cₙ₋₂ + C₂×Cₙ₋₃ + … + Cₙ₋₂×C₁ + Cₙ₋₁
The iᵗʰ summand corresponds to the number of triangulations possible when the fixed edge forms a triangle with the vertex (i + 2), where i is a number from 1 to n. By what we saw: C₁ = 1, C₂ = 2, C₃ = 5, C₄ = 14, C₅ = 42, … .</p>

<h3>Extension 2</h3>

<p>Can you find the answer to the same question if the cake has the shape of a nine-sided nonagon? </p>

<p><b>Hint: </b> Can you reuse previous results to compute this number? Counting explicitly might be too long. Can you come up with a way to reduce the problem in simpler cases you have already counted? Focus on when a fixed edge of the heptagon is present in a certain triangle. The heptagon is then split into two parts, the one at the left of the above triangle and the one at the right. Both parts are smaller...</p>

<p><b>Explanation: </b> So far, the result for 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 sides, the results of which are 1, 2, 5, 14, and 42 respectively). To find 8 sides we can do 42 + 1×14 + 2×5 + 5×2 + 14×1 + 42 = 132. Finally for 9 sides we have 132 + 1×42 + 2×14 + 5×5 + 14×2 + 42×1+132 = 429 </p>

<h2> D3 - Scoring Goals</h2>

<p>In the final of a football cup the score was 5 - 2. In how many possible orders could the goals in the game be scored?</p>

<p><b>Hint: </b> Imagine the sequence of all goals and think about the positions in the sequence in which the second football team can have scored their 2 goals. Try to find the answer in the cases the score was 3 - 2 or 4 - 2.</p>

<p><b>Explanation: </b> Imagine the score was only 3 - 2. Let us think about three goals scored by the first(home) team (HHH) and two goals scored by the second (away) team (AA). We could try and list the possibilities. e.g. AAHHH would represent the first two goals scored by the away team and then the next three goals scored by the home team. All the options for the five goals are : AAHHH, AHAHH, AHHAH, AHHHA, HAAHH, HAHAH, HAHHA, HHAAH, HHAHA, HHHAA. There are 10 options in total. A way to calculate this is to think about there being 5 options for one away goal: _ <em> _ </em> _ it could be in one of any of the 5 positions (e.g. A _ <em> _ </em>) . The other away goal could be in one of the remaining 4 positions. So you would think there would be 5×4 = 20 ways of choosing where the two goals would go.   However, we have double counted, because we have included every possibility (e.g. AAHHH) twice (one goal in position 1 and the other in position 2 but also the other way around). The order in which we selected the 2 goals of the second team does not matter: we need to divide by 2. So the answer if the score was 5 - 2 is 5×4 ∕ 2 = 10. </p>
<p>For the question of how many ways can the goals be scored if the score is 5 - 2, we can use the same logic. There are 7 possibilities to select the position for one goal; then there are 7 - 1 = 6 possibilities to select the position of the other goal ("-1" because one position has already been selected), therefore you get 7×6 = 42. However, the order in which you selected the 2 goals of the away team does not matter: you need to divide by 2. So we get 7×6 ∕ 2 = 21.</p>

<p><b>About: </b> Combinatorics is an area of mathematics primarily concerned with counting. Two big aspects of combinatorics are finding combinations and permutations. For combinations the order does not matter - like in our football example we didn't mind which order the away team scored the goals. For permutations the order does matter - for example there are six ways to arrange the digits 123.</p>

<h3>Extension 1</h3>

<p>In the final of a football cup the score was 6 - 2. In how many possible orders could the goals in the game be scored? </p>

<p><b>Hint: </b> Think about the strategy you used to answer the previous question and try to generalise it for any number of goals scored by the first team. </p>

<p><b>Explanation: </b> The answer is 8×7 ∕ 2=28</p>
<p>This problem is equivalent to counting how many ways you select 2 objects (the positions of the two goals of the second team in the sequence above) from a total of n objects (the total number of positions of the goals). This is calculated by the number of <em>combinations</em> ⁿC₂=n! ∕ (2!×(n-2)!) = n×(n - 1) ∕ 2. </p>
<p>In this formula n! = n×(n - 1)×(n - 2)×…×1</p>
<p>You can use this to come up with the formula generalising the reasoning in the previous part: there are n possibilities to select the position of the first goal of the second team; then there are (n - 1) possibilities to select the position of the second goal of the second team ("-1" because one position has already been selected), therefore you get n×(n-1). However, the order in which you selected the 2 positions for the two goals in the sequence does not matter: you need to divide by 2.</p>

<h3>Extension 2</h3>

<p>In the final of a football cup the score was 4 - 3. In how many possible orders could the goals in the game be scored?</p>

<p><b>Hint: </b> Think about the strategy you used to answer the previous question and try to generalise it for any number of goals scored by the first team. </p>

<p><b>Explanation: </b> If we think about the sequence of 4 + 3 = 7 goals (G₁, G₂, G₃, G₄, G₅, G₆, and G₇), then the problem is equivalent to counting how many ways you select 3 objects (the positions of the three goals of the second team in the sequence above) from a total of 7 objects (the total number of positions of the goals). There are 7 possibilities to select the position for the first goal; then there are 7 - 1 = 6 possibilities to select the position of the second goal ("-1" because one position has already been selected); there are 7 - 2 = 5 possibilities to select the position of the third goal ("-2" because two positions have already been selected). Therefore you get 7×6×5 = 210. However, the order in which you selected the 3 goals of the second team does not matter: you need to divide by the number of ways you can order the 3 goals. You have 3 ways of picking the first goal; then you have 3 - 1 = 2 ways to pick the second ("-1" because one goal has already been selected); there are 3 - 2 = 1 possibilities to select the third goal ("-2" because two goals have already been selected); therefore you get 3×2×1 = 6 ways you can order 3 goals. Finally, you can find the result by doing: 210 ∕ 6 = 35.</p>

<h2> D4 - Colouring</h2>

<p>How many tricolour flags are possible with 5 available colours such that two adjacent stripes must NOT be the same colour.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/Colouring_image_0.png" class="Colouring_image_0" /></p>

<p><b>Hint: </b> Think about how many different colours could go in the first section, then the second ...</p>

<p><b>Explanation: </b> There is a choice of 5 colours for the first section. Once a colour has been chosen, the second section cannot be the same. So there are only four colours to choose from for the second section. For the third section, there are four colours to choose from, as it cannot be the same colour as the second one yet it can be the same colour as the first one. Thus, the number of tricolour flags with 5 colours to choose from are 5×4×4 = 80.</p>

<p><b>About: </b> In a room with an even number of walls, two colors are always enough. For rooms with an odd number of walls, you will need three colors.</p>

<p>In how many different ways can I paint the five walls of a pentagonal room using red, blue and green paint so that no two neighbouring walls are the same colour?</p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/Colouring_image_1.png" class="Colouring_image_1" /></p>

<p><b>Hint: </b> Fix one colour, say start with the top wall red, and try to list all the different options for the other walls.  </p>

<p><b>Explanation: </b> First of all you start with either red, blue or green and use one of the other colours for the second side and so on around the pentagon. When you get to the last side it cannot be the same as the fourth side or the first one.</p>
<p>We can represent the choices of colours in a tree diagram, At the top (known as the root of the tree) we paint the first side. Here we choose red). The first split is the choice of either green or blue for the second side. The next split is the choice for the third side which depends on your choice of the second side. Any path from the root to end of the tree (known as a leaf) gives you a choice for all of the five edges. We see if we started with red, we have 10 different colourings. </p>
<p>As we can make similar diagrams if we had chosen green or blue in the first position, we have a total of 3×10 = 30 different colourings. </p>

<h2> D5 - Avoid the River</h2>

<p>Start from home (H) and go to school (S). You can walk along the 4 by 4 grid by making steps only towards east or north. You cannot cross the river (blue line)! In how many ways can you reach your school?</p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/Avoid_the_River_image_0.png" class="Avoid_the_River_image_0" /></p>

<p><b>Hint: </b> In how many ways you can go from home to school in a 2 by 2 grid? What about in a 3 by 3 grid?</p>

<p><b>Explanation: </b> This is not an easy combinatorial problem. It is better to start with a simpler version and familiarise with the problem. It is indeed intuitive to find the result for 2 by 2 grid: there are indeed only 2 possible ways. As far as the 3 by 3 case is concerned, students might easily draw all 5 ways explicitly. However, when it comes to the 4 by 4 case, it is easy to lose the count. Therefore the problem aims at making students think how to tackle this counting in a more systematic way. In particular, students should think whether they can decompose their counting in a way they can employ results known for a lower number of people. They may notice for example that the result for a 3 by 3 grid is: 2 + 1 + 2 = 5, 2 is the result for a 2 by 2 grid. Moreover, the result for a 4 by 4 grid is 5 + 2 + 2 + 5 = 14, where 2 is the result for a 2 by 2 and 5 is the result for a 3 by 3 grid.</p>

<p><b>About: </b> Cₙ are called <em>Catalan numbers</em> and they are crucial in the world of combinatorics. There is an explicit formula for them, but finding it goes much beyond our scopes: the recursive definition we find out in this puzzle is more than enough for now!</p>

<h3>Extension 1</h3>

<p>In how many ways you can go from home to school in a 5 by 5 grid? Try using previous results to compute this!</p>

<p><b>Hint: </b> Counting explicitly might be too long. Can you come up with a way to reduce the problem in simpler cases you have already counted? Focus on when a path last touches the river before reaching the school. Do you know anything about all possible paths that can reach that point? What about all possible paths after that point? </p>

<p><b>Explanation: </b> This part is aimed at finding a recursive way to solve the problem. It might not be easy. 
Let us number the points in which the paths might intersect the river from 1 to 6 starting from home to school. Let us focus our attention on the paths which last touch the river in point 6: these are all paths (so not useful); let us consider all paths that last touch the river in point 5. The bottom part of the problem is equivalent to counting all paths from home up to point 5 (such that they do not cross the river), these are exactly the one counted in a 4 by 4 grid previously: there are 14. For the top part, there is only one way to reach school from point 5. Therefore we have 14×1 = 14 paths that touch the river in point 5 for the last time before reaching school. Now let us consider the number of paths that last touches the river in point 4. The bottom part of the problem is equivalent to counting all paths from home up to point 4 (such that they do not cross the river), these are exactly the one counted in a 3 by 3 grid previously: there are 5. Starting from point 4 there is now only one way to reach school without touching the river again. Therefore we have a total of 5×1 = 5 paths.
Now let us consider the number of paths that last touches the river in point 3. The bottom part of the problem is equivalent to counting all paths from home up to point 3 (such that they do not cross the river), these are exactly the one counted in a 2 by 2 grid previously: there are 2. Starting from point 3, you need to move one step east. From here, you can not go north (otherwise you touch the river), but can only go East again. From here you can go one step East or one step North, but not two steps North (otherwise you would touch the river). And so on. You might realise you are solving the problem for a 2 by 2 grid whose bottom left corner is the point one step East to point 3 and the top right corner one step south the point 6. Therefore you have 2 paths. 
In total you have 2×2 = 4 paths which last touch the river in the point 3. You then continue by considering the number of paths that last touch the river in point 2. You realise that you split the problem in the one for a 1 by 1 grid and for a 3 by 3 grid (whose bottom left corner is the point at one step East to point 2 and the top right corner one step south the point 6). Therefore we have in total 1×5 paths. Finally the number of paths which last touch the river in point 1 (i.e. only touch the river in point 1) are the same as the paths for the problem with 4 by 4 grid (whose bottom left corner is the point at one step East to point 1 and the top right corner one step south the point 6). Therefore we have 14 paths.
We covered all possible paths which do not cross the river. In total they add up as: 14 + 1×5 + 2×2 + 5×1 + 14 = 42.</p>
<p>You might be able now to find a recursion relation for the number Cₙ of east and north paths in an n by n grid which do not cross the diagonal. Generalising what you did before we have that:
Cₙ = Cₙ₋₁ + C₁×Cₙ₋₂ + C₂×Cₙ₋₃ + … + Cₙ₋₂×C₁ + Cₙ₋₁</p>
<p>The iᵗʰ summand corresponds to the number of paths which last touch the diagonal at the point i, (where i is a number from 1 to n). </p>

<p><b>Hint: </b> Counting explicitly might be too long. Can you come up with a way to reduce the problem in simpler cases you have already counted? Focus on when a path last touches the river before reaching the school. Do you know anything about all possible paths that can reach that point? What about all possible paths after that point? </p>

<p><b>Explanation: </b> We already calculated C₄ = C₃ + C₁×C₂ + C₂×C₁ + C₃ = 5 + 1×2 +2×1 + 5 = 14</p>
<p>and C₅ = 42</p>

<h2> D6 - Shaking Hands</h2>

<p>At your friend's birthday there are 8 children. Each child shakes hands with all the others in the party. How many handshakes happened in total? </p>

<p><b>Hint: </b> Start with a small number of children, e.g. 3, 4, or 5. What is the number of handshakes you have to add if another child joins the party? </p>

<p><b>Explanation: </b> By counting from small examples, you may realise that each time you add a person at the birthday party with n children, the number of handshakes increases by n.</p>
<p>If we have 2 children (say A and B) we just have 1 handshake AB. </p>
<p>When we have 3 children (say A, B, and C) we have 3 handshakes: AB, AC, and BC. There is the original one and 2 extra ones now that C has joined. 1 + 2 = 3.  </p>
<p>If we add another child (say D) they must shake hands with A, B, and C and all the other handshakes still take place. So there will be 1 + 2 + 3 = 6 handshakes</p>
<p>If we add another child to this group of 4, then there will be another 4 handshakes.So 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10 handshakes.</p>
<p>If we follow this pattern we can find the answer for 8 children is 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 28.</p>
<p>Another way to think about it is if you are one of the 8 children, you need to shake hands with the 7 other people. So does every other child at the party. Since there are 8 of you, and you each shake hands with 7 other people, there should be 8×7 handshakes. However, as it takes 2 people to shake hands we have counted each handshake twice. So we divide by two and the answer is 8×7 ∕ 2 = 28 </p>

<p><b>About: </b> This is a classic puzzle that has been around for many years. There are many problem-solving strategies that can be used to find the solution - act it out, draw a diagram, look for a pattern, solve a simpler problem, make an organized list, make a table, use logical reasoning, . . . . The solution has deep mathematical properties and is a key result in the field of combinatorics. The number of handshakes is always a <strong>triangular number. </strong>The first ten triangular numbers are 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55, …</p>

<h3>Extension 1</h3>

<p>The whole school came to the birthday party: there are now 100 children! How many handshakes happen?</p>

<p><b>Hint: </b> Can you find a formula for the number of handshakes when there are n children at the birthday party? Think about the strategy you used to answer the previous question and try to generalise it for any number of children.</p>

<p><b>Explanation: </b> Generalising what you found earlier, you can come up with the rule that for a birthday party with n children you have 1 + 2 + … + (n - 1) handshakes. You may realise that you can then use a formula (n×(n - 1) ∕ 2) to calculate the number of handshakes. For 100 children there are 100×99 ∕ 2 = 4950 handshakes. This is the same as adding up the numbers 1 + 2 + 3 + …+ 99.</p>

<h3>Extension 2</h3>

<p>A bigger school had a party. There were 28680 handshakes! How many children were there?</p>

<p><b>Hint: </b> Can you find a formula for the number of handshakes when there are n children at the birthday party? Think about the strategy you used to answer the previous question and try to generalise it for any number of children.</p>

<p><b>Explanation: </b> The formula for the number of handshakes for n children is n×(n - 1) ∕ 2. We need to find the value of n such that n×(n - 1) ∕ 2=28680. Multiplying by two gives us n×(n - 1) = 57360. Notice that we roughly want n×n = 57360 so try taking the square root of 57360. This gives 239.49947… So let us try 240, which indeed gives 240×239/2 = 28680.</p>

<h2> D7 - Pieces of Cake</h2>

<p>What is the biggest number of pieces of a circular cake you can obtain with 5 straight cuts? Cuts must be made on the top of the cake.</p>

<p><b>Hint: </b> Start with a small number of cuts, e.g. 1, 2, 3. How can you add another cut to get the biggest number of pieces? Remember it doesn't say that the pieces have to be the same size! What happens if many cuts pass through the same point?</p>

<p><b>Explanation: </b> With one cut you always get 2 pieces. With two cuts you can get 4 pieces. With three cuts, if all cuts pass through the same point you get 6 pieces. However, you can get 7 pieces if the third cut doesn't pass through the same point as the previous two. Use this idea to get the maximum number with four cuts. So to get the most pieces, make sure that no more than two cuts pass through the same point, otherwise you get less pieces. With four cuts you can get 11 pieces. Do the same again for five cuts, start with the four cuts that give 7 pieces and add a cut without passing through any meeting points (intersections) and you can get 16 pieces.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/Pieces_of_Cake_image_0.png" class="Pieces_of_Cake_image_0" /></p>

<p><b>About: </b> If you were allowed to cut the cake in any direction, not just from the top, with just three cuts you could cut it into 8 pieces (rather than only 6)!</p>

<h3>Extension 1</h3>

<p>What is the biggest number of pieces of cake you can obtain with 7 cuts?</p>

<p><b>Hint: </b> As the number of cuts increases, drawing and counting might be too complicated: can you spot the pattern in the sequence of numbers obtained from previous examples? For 7 cuts, first work out the answer for 6 cuts and then use this result.</p>

<p><b>Explanation: </b> You might realise that there is a formula for obtaining the next number in the sequence from the previous one. You can see this by working out the number of new pieces created when you add an extra cut. For example, adding a fourth cut to 7 pieces obtained from 3 cuts adds 4 new pieces (11). Adding a fifth cut to this adds 5 new pieces (16). (Can you see why this is true in general when thinking about how we cross the existing cuts to create the most pieces?)</p>
<p>So if C is the number of cuts and P(C) is the maximum number of pieces from C cuts, then the formula is: </p>
<p>P(C + 1) = P(C) + C + 1</p>
<p>Therefore:
P(6) = P(5) + 5 + 1 = 16 + 6 = 22
P(7) = P(6) + 6 + 1 = 22 + 7 = 29</p>

<h3>Extension 2</h3>

<p>Can you work out the biggest number of pieces you can get with 99 cuts?</p>

<p><b>Hint: </b> As the number of cuts increases, drawing and counting might be too complicated: can you spot the pattern in the sequence of numbers obtained from previous examples? For 7 cuts, first work out the answer for 6 cuts and then use this result.</p>

<p><b>Explanation: </b> We found the formula P(C + 1) = P(C) + C + 1 for the maximum number of pieces giving the cuts. However, this is not practical to use for the case of 99 cuts because we would first need to know the number of pieces for 98 cuts, and then the number of pieces for 97 cuts, and so on. You have to think how to get the explicit formula: P(C) = ½×C×(C + 1) + 1.</p>
<p>Either by intuition or by using the formula to work back from P(C) to P(1):
P(C) = P(C - 1) + C - 1 + 1 </p>
<p>= P(C - 1) + C  </p>
<p>= P(C - 2) + (C - 1) + C</p>
<p>= P(C - 3) + (C - 2) + (C - 1)  + C</p>
<p>… </p>
<p>= P(1) + 2 + 3 … + (C - 2) + (C - 1) + C</p>
<p>= 2 + (2 + 3 + … + C)</p>
<p>= 1 + (1 + 2 + 3 + … + C) </p>
<p>= 1 + ½×C×(C + 1)</p>
<p>The last step is obtained from what we know about triangular numbers.
Therefore, P(99) = ½×99×100 = 4951.</p>
<p>This problem is related to the number of regions (pieces of the cake) in a plane bounded by a generic configuration of lines (cuts). "Generic" means that there are no parallel lines and that no more than two lines intersect in the same points. This guarantees that the number of pieces of cake is maximal. Given C lines on a plane (in a generic configuration), then adding an extra line such that it intersects all the previous lines would create (C+1) new regions (around each intersection point of the new line with the previous ones, we add two new regions. However, one of the two is counted also in the next intersection point). This leads to P(C + 1) = P(C) + C + 1.</p>

<h2> D8 - Mixed-up Socks</h2>

<p>You have a pair of red socks, a pair of blue socks, a pair of yellow socks, and a pair of green socks. In how many ways can you mix them up and form new pairs so that all the new pairs are mismatched, and none of the new (mismatched) pairs is the same as another new (mismatched) pair? </p>

<p><b>Hint: </b> Start with matching one of the red with one of the green, and the other red with a blue. You could write this as RB, RY. What would the other two pairs have to be? </p>

<p><b>Explanation: </b> You can solve this problem by listing all the options. You could have RB, RY, YG, BG or RB, RG, GY, BY or RY, RG, YB, GB. You could also solve it by thinking that, starting with the red socks, there are three different colours that the two socks could be matched with. If you choose RB and RY as the first two pairs, you can't then match BY together because that would leave GG for the last pair which isn't allowed. So once you have picked the two colours to go with red, there are no more choices to make. There are 3 ways to pick two colours from a choice of three, so the answer is 3.</p>

<p><b>About: </b> For four different pairs of socks, if they were loose in a drawer and you shut your eyes and matched them together at random there would be a 1% chance of matching them perfectly and a 46% chance of matching them completely wrongly as in the puzzle.</p>

<h3>Extension 1</h3>

<p>You have five pairs of socks, each a different colour (red, blue, yellow, green, orange). Mix them up and form new pairs so that all the new pairs are mismatched, and none of the new (mismatched) pairs is the same as another new (mismatched) pair. </p>
<p>In how many ways can you mix them up and form new pairs in this way?</p>

<p><b>Hint: </b> Start off with the two red socks. Can you work out how many ways there are of choosing which two colours these two socks could be matched with?</p>

<p><b>Explanation: </b> Starting with the red socks, there are four different colours that the two socks could be matched with. If you choose RB and RY as the first two pairs, you cannot then have BY as a pair. This is because it would only leave two green and two orange socks and you can't have GG or OO and you can't have GO twice. You could match the second blue sock with green or orange. Once you choose one the other two pairs are fixed. For example RB, RY, BG then it must be OG and OY. </p>
<p>There are 6 ways to pick two colours from a choice of four, and then 2 ways to pick one colour from a choice of two, so the answer is 6×2 = 12.</p>

<h3>Extension 2</h3>

<p>Imagine you have a bag with 3 red marbles, a bag with 3 blue marbles, a bag with 3 green marbles, and a bag with 3 yellow ones. If the order of the bags doesn't matter, in how many ways can we mix up and sort the marbles into the 4 different bags with 3 different coloured marbles each?</p>

<p><b>Hint: </b> Start off with the two red socks. Can you work out how many ways there are of choosing which two colours these two socks could be matched with?</p>

<p><b>Explanation: </b> It helps in a problem such as this one to think primarily about the colour of the marble that <em>doesn't</em> get picked to be included in the first bag. Since we have four colours and bags that hold three marbles, and since we can't have two of the same colour in the same bag, there are four ways in which we can fill the first bag (think: in each possible combination, one colour gets excluded, and with four colours of marbles, there are four potential colours to exclude from the first bag. Now, what does that mean for the colour that wasn't included in the first bag. Let's refer to the three colours included in the first bag as a, b, and c. That leaves d to denote the colour that was excluded. Because we cannot have two of the same colour marble in any given bag, each of the remaining bags must contain one d marble. Now let's move on to the second bag. The second bag already has a colour d in it, and only has room for two more. There are three colours left to choose from, so we once again arrive at a situation where it's best to think in terms of what colour we are excluding. We must pick 2 marbles from a list of 3, so we must exclude 1. Whatever colour we exclude will have two remaining that must go into the two remaining bags. The colours that were included in the second bag each have one remaining to be placed inside a bag. We now arrive at the third bag, which already has a marble of the colour excluded from the first bag, and a marble of the colour excluded from the second. We then have two options to pick from, and the one we don't pick will go into the fourth bag, whose makeup will already be decided. We thus have 4×3×2×1 = 24 ways of placing the marbles into the four bags. Because the order of the bags doesn't matter, we must divide this number by the number of ways that four bags can be ordered, which is equal to 4×3×2×1 = 24. We thus get 24 / 24 = 1.</p>

<h2> D10 - Going to School</h2>

<p>Start from home (H) and go to school (S). You can walk along the 2 by 5 grid by making steps only towards east or north. In how many ways can you reach your school?</p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/Going_to_School_image_0.png" class="Going_to_School_image_0" /></p>

<p><b>Hint: </b> What is the total number of steps you have to make? Think about when you could make the two steps north.
You could first try to find the answer if the grid was 2 by 3 and 2 by 4.</p>

<p><b>Explanation: </b> First of all, we can realise that, in order to get to school, you need to do a total of 2 steps north and 5 steps east. If we think about the sequence of 2 + 5 = 7 steps (S1, S2, S3, S4, S5, S6, and S7), then the problem is equivalent to counting how many ways you select 2 objects (the positions of the two steps towards north) from a total of 7 objects (the total number of positions of the steps). There are 7 possibilities to select the position for the first step towards north; then there are 7 - 1 = 6 possibilities to select the position of the second step towards north ("-1" because one position has already been selected), therefore you get 6×7 = 42. However, the order in which you selected the 2 positions of the steps towards north does not matter: you need to divide by 2, to give the final answer of 21.</p>
<p>Alternatively, we could look at smaller examples first.</p>
<p>Let N be one step north and E be one step east. </p>
<p>For a 2 by 2 grid we could have NNEE, NENE, NEEN, ENNE, ENEN, EENN  (6 ways)</p>
<p>For a 2 by 3 grid we need an extra move east. We could add an E onto all the options above. We would then just be missing all the routes that had N as the last move. There are 4 of these, corresponding to the other N in each one of the first four positions.</p>
<p>NNEE(E), NENE(E), NEEN(E), ENNE(E), ENEN(E), EENN(E) (6 ways) plus NEEEN, ENEEN, EENEN, EEENN (4 ways) = 10 ways</p>
<p>For a 2 by 4 grid there are 10 + 5 = 15 ways</p>
<p>For a 2 by 5 grid there are 15 + 6 = 21 ways</p>
<p>In general, by counting from small examples, we can see that each time you increase by one the number n of total steps (while keeping the number of steps towards north to 2), the number of ways you can go to school increases by n - 1. This is because you have already counted the ways the steps towards north can be in all the previous positions from 1 to n - 1. Therefore you just need to add the possibility that the two steps towards north are in the position n and any other of the n - 1 remaining ones. </p>

<p><b>About: </b> This puzzle is all about finding the number of ways of choosing r items from a choice of n items when the order doesn't matter. The mathematical word for this is <strong>combinations</strong>, and there is a formula for finding them: ⁿCᵣ = n! ∕ (r!×(n - r)!)</p>

<p>In how many ways could you reach your school if it were further away in the top right of a 2 by 10 grid? </p>

<p><b>Hint: </b> Think about the strategy you used to answer the previous question and try to generalise in the case the school is in the top right (north-east) of a 2 by n grid. </p>

<p><b>Explanation: </b> You can come up with a formula generalising the reasoning in the previous part: there are n+2 possibilities to select the position for the first step towards north; then there are n+1 possibilities to select the position of the second step towards north (1 less because one position has already been selected), therefore you get (n + 2)×(n + 1). However, the order in which you selected the 2 positions of the steps towards north does not matter: you then need to divide by 2.</p>
<p>Alternatively, generalising what you found earlier, you might come up with the rule that for a 2×n grid you have 1 + 2 + … + (n + 1) possible paths to school. There is a quick way of adding these numbers together - it is (n + 1)×(n + 2) ∕ 2. </p>
<p>So we can calculate the answer for a 2 by 10 grid by doing 12×11 ∕ 2 = 66. </p>

<h3>Extension 2</h3>

<p>In how many ways could you reach your school if it were in the top right of a 4 by 5 grid? </p>

<p><b>Hint: </b> Think about the strategy you used to answer the previous question and try to generalise in the case the school is in the top right (north-east) of a 2 by n grid. </p>

<p><b>Explanation: </b> We need to take four steps north and 5 steps east. One way to do this would be in the sequence NNNNEEEEE. We need to find all the different ways. Consider the position of the four steps north. Let's call them N₁, N₂, N₃, and N₄. N₁ could be in any one of 9 positions, then N₂ could go in any of the 8 that are left, then N₃ is one of the remaining 7 and finally N₄ in one of the remaining 6. This would give us 9×8×7×6 = 3024 ways. But we actually don't want to distinguish between the four north steps. N₁N₂N₃N₄EEEEE is the same as N₂N₁N₃N₄EEEEE for example. So the 126 has included all the different ways the N₁ up to N₄ could be arranged. We now need to work out how many ways this is. The N₁ could be in one of four positions, the N₂ then in one of three, the N₃ in one of two and the N₄ in the one left. This gives us 4×3×2×1 = 24 ways. So we overcounted by a factor of 24. The final answer is 3024 ∕ 24 = 126. </p>

<h2> DJ - Different Paths</h2>

<p>There are 5 different paths you could take to get from home to school. In a week (from Monday to Friday) you would like to try a different path every day. In how many ways can you do this? </p>

<p><b>Hint: </b> Think about how many options you have to select the first path, then how many you have for the second and so on. Be careful that you can not choose the same path twice in a week.</p>

<p><b>Explanation: </b> You have 5 possible days of the week and you would like to have one different path per day. ON the first day you have a choice of 5 paths. On the second day, you only have 4 paths left to choose from because you can't take the one you took on Monday. On the third day you have 3 to choose from and so on. The solution is therefore 5×4×3×2×1 =120. This is counting how many ways you can order 5 objects (paths) in 5 positions (days of the week). This is a problem on <em>permutations</em> (without repetition). </p>
<p>The mathematical symbol ! is called <em>factorial</em> and represents multiplying by decreasing integers until you reach 1. So 5×4×3×2×1 can be written as 5!  </p>

<p><b>About: </b> Factorials were used to count permutations at least as early as the 12th century, by Indian scholars. The notation n! was introduced by the French mathematician Christian Kramp in 1808.</p>
<p>Factorials get big very quickly. 5! = 120, but 20! = 2432902008176640000.</p>

<h3>Extension 1</h3>

<p>What if you had to go to school on Saturdays as well and you also found a new path? In how many ways can you arrange your week such that every day you go to school walking on different paths? </p>

<p><b>Hint: </b> Is there a way to use the result of the previous problem? Think about how many ways you can now walk to school on Monday.</p>

<p><b>Explanation: </b> You have now 6 possible days of the week and 6 different paths. You would like to have one different path per day. The solution is obtained by counting how many ways you can order 6 objects (paths) in 6 positions (days of the week). The solution is obtained as 6×5×4×3×2×1 = 120  Notice this is 6×120 (6 times the previous solution). You have just discovered a recursive property of factorials: n! = n×(n - 1)!.</p>

<h3>Extension 2</h3>

<p>What if you had to go to school on Sundays as well and you also found four new paths so there are now 10 paths to choose from? In how many ways can you arrange your week such that every day you go to school walking on different paths? </p>

<p><b>Hint: </b> Is there a way to use the result of the previous problem? Think about how many ways you can now walk to school on Monday.</p>

<p><b>Explanation: </b> You have now 7 possible days of the week and 10 different paths. You would like to have one different path per day. The solution is obtained by counting how many ways you can order 10 objects (paths) in 7 positions (days of the week). The solution is obtained by 10×9×8×7×6×5×4 =  604800. If you wanted to calculate this using factorials, 10! is close to the answer, but we don't want 3×2×1 at the end. 3×2×1 is 3! so we can do 10! ∕ 3! =604800.  </p>

<h2> DQ - Bar Stools</h2>

<p>How many different ways can you arrange teachers and students in a row of 5 chairs such that no 2 teachers are sat next to each other?</p>

<p><b>Hint: </b> You could have five students sitting on the five chairs. You could have two teachers sitting on chairs number 2 and 4 and students in chairs 1, 3, and 5. Can you think of any other options? Can you think of the maximum number of teachers that could sit on the chairs? You might like to start with a smaller number of chairs and work your way up.</p>

<p><b>Explanation: </b> Think of chairs as having a teacher (x) or a student (o).</p>
<p>For 5 chairs we can have</p>
<p>ooooo, xoooo, oxooo, ooxoo, oooxo, oooox, xoxoo, xooxo, xooox, oxoxo, oxoox, ooxox, xoxox</p>
<p>Total  = 13</p>
<p>There is a way we can build up to this solution by thinking about the answer if there was 1 chair, 2 chairs, 3 chairs etc. </p>
<p>1 chair has 2 options: x , o</p>
<p>2 chairs has 3 options: ox, oo, xo</p>
<p>3 chairs has 5 options: oox, ooo, oxo, xox, xoo</p>
<p>Each time you add a chair you can generate the new options by simply adding a student to the start of all the previous options. You can also add a teacher and then a student to all of the options from two chairs ago. Let's see this with 4 chairs:</p>
<p>Add o onto all the 3 chair options gives:</p>
<p>ooox, oooo, ooxo, oxox, oxoo</p>
<p>And adding xo onto all the 2 chair options gives:</p>
<p>xoox, xooo, xoxo</p>
<p>This gives 5 + 3 = 8 options in total. </p>
<p>For the 5 chairs we can add o onto all the 4 chairs options and and xo onto all the 3 chair options which gives 8 + 5 = 13 as before.</p>

<p><b>About: </b> The sequence of numbers in this puzzle are part of the Fibonacci Sequence sequence: </p>
<p>0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34,... It is easy to find the next number by adding the previous two numbers, but you can also find the nᵗʰ Fibonacci number in the sequence directly using this formula:</p>

<h3>Extension 1</h3>

<p>How many different ways can you arrange teachers and students in a row of 10 chairs such that no 2 teachers are sat next to each other?</p>

<p><b>Hint: </b> Try and build up the answer from a smaller number of chairs.</p>

<p><b>Explanation: </b> We had already found the following sequence for 1 chair, 2 chairs, 3 chairs , … </p>
<p>2, 3, 5, 8, 13</p>
<p>Each term in the sequence can be found by adding the two previous terms. We can carry it on:</p>
<p>2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144</p>
<p>So there are 144 ways to have people sitting on the 10 chairs.</p>

<h3>Extension 2</h3>

<p>For all the number of chairs between 1 and 30 inclusive, how many of these will have an even number of ways of sitting on them?</p>

<p><b>Hint: </b> Try and build up the answer from a smaller number of chairs.</p>

<p><b>Explanation: </b> For the sequence 2,3,5,8,13, … we can see that there is a pattern even, odd, odd, even, odd odd, etc. This makes sense as even + odd = odd and odd + odd = even. So every third number in the sequence is even. We need to do 30 ∕ 3 = 10. </p>

<h2> DK - Paving Paths</h2>

<p>How many different ways can you lay 6 paving slabs, each 2 meters by 1 meter, to make a path 2 meters wide and 6 meters long from my back door into my garden, without cutting any of the paving slabs?</p>

<p><b>Hint: </b> In how many different ways can you do that in case you had fewer paving slabs for a shorter path? Think about a good strategy to classify different ways. For example, how many ways can you have 2 pairs of slabs lengthwise?</p>

<p><b>Explanation: </b> This problem is firstly meant to make you think about a good strategy to count. You can draw all possibilities for shorter paths. However, this will soon become too lengthy. A first step towards finding an organizing principle could be classifying the paths accordingly to how many pairs of 
slabs placed lengthwise there are. Let us denote as n the number of paving slabs.
For n = 1, there is clearly only one possibility (no pairs); for n = 2 there are 2 possibilities (no pairs, and 1 pair); for n = 3 there are 1×(no pairs) + 2×(1 pair) = 3 ways; for n = 4 there are 1×(no pairs) + 3×(1 pair) + 1×(2 pairs)= 5. Using this strategy we can easily count n = 6: there are 1×(no pairs) + 5×(1 pair) + 6×(2 pairs) + 1×(3 pairs) = 13. Looking at the sequence 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, …you might recognize the pattern!</p>

<p><b>About: </b> The sequence of numbers in this puzzle are part of the Fibonacci sequence: </p>

<h3>Extension 1</h3>

<p>How many different ways can you lay the 11 paving slabs of the same type to make a path 2 meters wide and 11 meters long, without cutting any of the paving slabs?</p>

<p><b>Hint: </b> Counting explicitly might be too long. Can you come up with a way to reduce the problem in simpler cases you have already counted?</p>

<p><b>Explanation: </b> Supposing you have to lay n slabs. Let us denote as F(n) the solution of the problem for n slabs. There are two ways you can end your path: either by laying the last pair of slabs lengthwise, or by laying the last slab across. In the first case, you are free to arrange the first (n - 2) slabs as you wish to make a path of length (n - 2) meters: there are exactly F(n - 2) ways of doing this. As far as the second case is concerned, you are then free to arrange the first (n - 1) slabs as you wish to make a path of length (n - 1) meters: there are exactly F(n - 1) ways of doing this. Therefore, you find that F(n) = F(n - 1) + F(n - 2): this is the proof for the recursion relation for your sequence of numbers! By previous experiments, it should be clear that F(1) = 1 and F(2) = 2.
We can now build the sequence easily: each term in the sequence can be found by adding the two previous terms. We can carry it on:</p>
<p>1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144</p>
<p>So there are 144 ways to lay the 11 paving slabs to make the path.</p>

<h3>Extension 2</h3>

<p>For all the paths built with a number of slabs between 1 and 30 inclusive, how many of these will have an odd number of ways of building them?</p>

<p><b>Hint: </b> Counting explicitly might be too long. Can you come up with a way to reduce the problem in simpler cases you have already counted?</p>

<p><b>Explanation: </b> For the sequence 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, … we can see that there is a pattern odd-even-odd, odd-even-odd, odd- etc. This makes sense as even + odd = odd and odd + odd = even. So in a sequence of 30 numbers, there are 30 ∕ 3×2= 20 odd numbers.</p>

<h2> H1 - Birthday Probability</h2>

<p>In a room of 23 people the probability that two people have the same birthday is more than 50%.</p>

<p><b>Hint: </b> The probability that two people have the same birthday is just 1 minus the probability of everyone's birthday being different.</p>
<p>You should ask yourself the following questions:</p>
<p>If we only have 2 people what is the probability their birthday is different? </p>
<p>If we had 5 people, in how many ways can we select two to compare their birthdays?</p>
<p>What do we get if we use the same approach for 23 people?</p>

<p><b>Explanation: </b> The probability of any 2 people having different birthdays is roughly 364 ∕ 365 there are 253 different pairs of people in a room of 23 people so the probability of them all having different birthdays is roughly 364 ∕ 365 to the power 253. This is 0.4995 slightly less than 50% so the probability of having 2 people in the room with the same birthday is just over 50%. Actually we should be including leap years but the result is still true if you do.</p>

<p><b>About: </b> This problem is not a paradox but it is counter-intuitive. The number of people needed seems surprisingly small, perhaps because we imagine ourselves as one of the people in the room and think of only 22 possibilities for a match, rather than thinking of the 253 different pairs of people in the room. </p>
<p>You can extend the birthday problem - you would only need 88 people to have a greater than 50% chance of 3 people sharing a birthday.</p>
<p>Have you experienced a surprising coincidence in your life? </p>
<p>Coincidences like meeting someone with exactly the same birthday as you are unlikely events on their own. However, as with the birthday problem, the number of events can increase exponentially meaning that in a group or over time it is more likely to have coincidences than not!</p>
<p>If you haven't had a coincidence yet don't worry if you keep looking it's unlikely that nothing unlikely will ever happen to you! </p>

<h3>Extension 1</h3>

<p>If there are 50 people in a room, what is the chance that two people share a birthday?</p>

<p><b>Hint: </b> Think about these questions: </p>
<p>How many possible pairs of people are there with 50 people in the room? </p>
<p>What is the chance that every pair of people have different birthdays to each other?</p>

<p><b>Explanation: </b> The number of pairs of people are 50x49 ∕ 2 = 1225. Chance of a unique pair is 364 ∕ 365. Chance of 1225 unique pairs is (364 ∕ 365)¹²²⁵ = 0.0347. Chance of at least one match is 1 - 0.0347 = 0.9653, which is 96.53%. So, incredibly likely!</p>

<h2> H2 - Kaprekar's Number</h2>

<p>Choose a four digit number where the digits are not all the same.</p>
<p>Rearrange the digits to get the largest and smallest numbers these digits can make.</p>
<p>Subtract the smallest number from the largest to get a new number, and carry on repeating the operation for each new number. You will always end up at the same number.</p>

<p><b>Hint: </b> For example if you start with 4252, you should do the calculation 5422 - 2245 = 3177. Then do 7731 - 1377 and keep going.</p>

<p><b>Explanation: </b> You always end up with the number 6174. This is known as Kaprekar's number. For example 5432 – 2345 = 3087</p>
<p>8730 – 0378 = 8352</p>
<p>8532 – 2358 = 6174</p>
<p>7641 – 1467 = 6174</p>

<p><b>About: </b> D. R. Kaprekar (1905 - 1986) was an Indian school maths teacher who loved playing with numbers. He discovered a number of results in number theory and described various properties of numbers.</p>

<h3>Extension 1</h3>

<p>What happens when you do this process with 3 digit numbers (where not all the digits are the same)? Can you explain why you always end up at the same number? Note that if you find 99 as an answer at any stage, this would then give 099 as the smallest number and 990 as the biggest.</p>

<p><b>Hint: </b> For example, if you start with 792, the first calculation you have to do is 972 - 279 = 693. </p>

<p><b>Explanation: </b> We can write a three digit number abc (imagine it is as big as possible) as 100×a + 10×b + c. If we rearrange the digits to make it as small as possible it would be cba which we can write as 100×c + 10×b + a. We then subtract to give 100×a + 10×b + c - (100×c + 10×b + a) = 99×a - 99×c = 99×(a - c). So after one step, the number will be a multiple of 99. The only 3 digit numbers that are multiples of 99 are 099, 198, 297, 396, 495, 594, 693, 792, 891, and 990. We only need to check the first five of these (as we will be rearranging the digits anyway) and we can verify that all of them end up giving the answer 495.</p>

<h2> H3 - Palindrome Cube</h2>

<p>2201³ = 10662526601 is the only known palindromic cube whose root is not palindromic (a palindrome is a number that reads the same backwards as forwards).</p>

<p><b>Hint: </b> Take the number 1030301. It is a palindrome. It's cube root is 101, which is also a palindrome. Can you find other examples that are both palindromes? (Remember that all one digit numbers are palindromes!)   </p>

<p><b>Explanation: </b> According to the On-line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences, The sequence of positive integers whose cube is palindromic begins:</p>
<p>1, 2, 7, 11, 101, 111, 1001, 2201, 10001, 10101, …</p>
<p>The corresponding sequence of palindromic cubes begins:</p>

<p>2201 is the smallest (and only one one known so far) which is itself non-palindromic. </p>

<p><b>About: </b> People have used computers to try and find another palindromic number whose cube root is not palindromic but no one has found one. This might be because there exists one that is bigger than the numbers that have been tested so far, or it might be that no more exist. </p>

<h2> H4 - Four Colours</h2>

<p>It takes at most four colours to colour every map such that no two adjacent regions are the same colour.</p>

<p><b>Hint: </b> Can you colour a map of Africa with five colours so that no two countries that touch are filled in with the same colour? Can you also succeed with four colours? How about three colours?</p>

<p><b>Explanation: </b> The four color theorem says that given any separation of a plane into contiguous regions, producing a figure called a map, no more than four colours are required to colour the regions of the map so that no two adjacent regions have the same colour. We can see why it is not possible with three colours by looking at the situation around Rwanda: </p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/Four_Colours_image_0.png" class="Four_Colours_image_0" /></p>
<p>If we try using red, blue and green we can get this far:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/Four_Colours_image_1.png" class="Four_Colours_image_1" /></p>
<p>But we can't colour Rwanda using red (because it shares a border with Uganda and Burundi) green (because of Tanzania) or blue (Democratic Republic of Congo). We definitely need another colour. </p>
<p>The proof that only four colours are needed is very tricky, but the extension will give you an insight into how it is done.</p>

<p><b>About: </b> The proof of the four colour theorem was famously tricky, and comes from graph theory, where mathematicians investigate an equivalent problem of colouring vertices of a network so that no edge has endpoints the same colour. The original four-colour proof was attempted by<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Kempe"> </a>Alfred Kempe in 1879, but unfortunately Percy John Heawood found an error 11 years later. However his work was not useless, as Percy was able to prove the five-colour theorem (that one can colour a map with no two adjacent regions the sample colour using at most 5 colours) based on Kempe's work. The four colour theorem was finally proved in 1976 by Kenneth Appel, Wolfgang Haken, and John Koch using a computer to check it. This was the first major theorem to be proved using a computer. They checked around 1500 configurations using about 1200 hours of computer time. Some people were sceptical about a proof using a computer but independent verification soon convinced everyone that the four colour theorem had finally been proved.</p>

<h3>Extension 1</h3>

<p>Can you draw a map with 12 countries such that every country has exactly five neighbours, and then colour it in using only 4 colours?</p>

<p><b>Hint: </b> Your map should essentially look like this:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/Four_Colours_image_2.png" class="Four_Colours_image_2" /></p>

<p><b>Explanation: </b> The idea of the proof of the four colour theorem is to find necessary conditions for being a minimal counterexample (this means a minimal non-4-colourable map) and thus to concentrate on maps with these necessary conditions. One of these many necessary conditions is to show that in a minimal counterexample with 12 countries, all countries must have exactly five neighbours. However this can be coloured in like this:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/Four_Colours_image_3.png" class="Four_Colours_image_3" /></p>

<h2> H5 - Ramanujan</h2>

<p>1729 is the smallest number expressible as a sum of two cube numbers in two different ways</p>

<p><b>Hint: </b> 72 can be expressed as 2³ + 4³ but it is the only way with two positive cubes. Can you find the two ways to make 1729?</p>

<p><b>Explanation: </b> 1³ + 12³ = 1 + 1728 = 1729 and also 9³ + 10³ = 729 + 1000 = 1729</p>

<p><b>About: </b> Bernard Frénicle de Bessy wrote about the number 1729 in 1657, but it was made popular by G. H. Hardy telling a story about Srinivasa Ramanujan in about 1919: "I remember once going to see him when he was ill at Putney. I had ridden in taxi cab number 1729 and remarked that the number seemed to me rather a dull one, and that I hoped it was not an unfavourable omen. "No," he replied, "it is a very interesting number; it is the smallest number expressible as the sum of two cubes in two different ways." 1729 is now called a "taxicab" number. It is the second taxi cab number. The first is 2 because it is the smallest number that can be written in one way as the sum of two cubes. 87539319 is the third taxi cab number because it is the smallest number that can be written in three different ways as the sum of two cubes. No one knows what the taxicab numbers are above the 6th one. </p>

<h2> H6 - Abundant Numbers</h2>

<p>The integer 12 is the first <strong>abundant number</strong>. Its proper divisors (factors not including 12 itself)  are 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 which add up to 16 which is more than 12. </p>

<p><b>Hint: </b> You could make a 10 by 10 grid of the numbers 1 to 100 and colour in the abundant numbers.</p>

<p><b>Explanation: </b> The next abundant number is 20, because the proper divisors of 20 are 1,2,4,5, and 10 which add up to 22. Can you explain why prime numbers can never be abundant?   </p>

<p><b>About: </b> The first known classification of numbers as deficient, perfect or abundant was by Nicomachus in his Introductio Arithmetica (circa 100)</p>

<h3>Extension 1</h3>

<p>Numbers whose proper divisors add up to less than the number are called deficient numbers. </p>

<p><b>Hint: </b> You could make a 10 by 10 grid of the numbers 1 to 100 and colour in the deficient numbers.</p>

<p><b>Explanation: </b> An example of a deficient number is 15, because 1,3, and 5 add up to 9 which is less than 15.</p>

<h2> H7 - Folding Paper</h2>

<p>If you could fold a piece of paper on itself only 42 times, it would reach the Moon! </p>

<p><b>Hint: </b> Let us say that the paper thickness is about 0.1 millimeter (or 0.0039 inch). If you fold it once on itself, how thick would it be? What about it you fold it once more on itself? What about if you fold it 10 times?</p>

<p><b>Explanation: </b> The distance between the Earth and the Moon is a bit less than 400000 kilometers (or 250000 miles). For us the paper is 0.1 millimeter (mm) thick. If we fold the paper once, its thickness would be doubled, so it becomes 0.2mm. Folding it again gives 0.4mm. If we fold it 10 times, it becomes (0.1mm)×2¹⁰ (two to the power 10). Now, if we compute (0.1mm)×2⁴², the result is 440 000km!</p>

<p><b>About: </b> Try to fold a piece paper 6 times, remember to fold it completely over itself at each repetition. Can you fold it a seventh time? An eighth? How far can you go? Maybe we need a larger piece of paper to begin with! It was thought for years that 7 was the maximum number of times a piece of paper could be folded, but in 2002 American teenager Britney Gallivan demonstrated that a sheet of paper can be folded 12 times, provided that it is long enough and thin enough.  Britney Gallivan demonstrated this by using a 1200m length of toilet paper, which provided her with both the length and thinness which she required.  Britney even came up with a formula that showed how long the piece of paper would have to be able to fold it n times:</p>
<p><!-- LaTeX Start --><!--$$ L = \frac{\pi \times t}{6} (2^n + 4)(2^n - 1) $$--><!-- LaTeX End --><!-- L = π×t×(2ⁿ + 4)(2ⁿ - 1) ∕ 6 --></p>
<p>L is the length of paper required, t is the thickness of the paper and n is how many folds you can make.</p>
<p>Ten years later in 2012 a group of students beat Britney's record by taking 16km of toilet roll and folding it in one direction 13 times. </p>

<h3>Extension 1</h3>

<p>How many times would you need to fold the same piece of paper to reach the height of Britam Tower, the highest skyscraper in Nairobi? (200m, or 640 ft)</p>

<p><b>Hint: </b> Make sure you convert 0.1mm to meters or 200m to millimeters first. </p>

<p><b>Explanation: </b> You would need to fold the paper 21 times. 200m is 200000mm. You need to solve (0.1mm)×2ⁿ = 200000 for n. We can solve equations like these using logarithms or just trial and error - keep multiplying by 2 until you have reached the height of the tower … 20 is nearly enough, but you would need 21 folds to reach over 200m tall. </p>

<h2> H8 - Prime Removal</h2>

<p>73939133 is the largest prime number that, if you keep removing digits from the right, will always leave a prime number.</p>

<p><b>Hint: </b> If you take away the last digit the number would be 7393913, which is a prime number. Keep going ...</p>

<p><b>Explanation: </b> A right-truncatable prime is a prime number that remains a prime when you successively remove the last digit. We can look for the biggest right-truncatable prime by starting with the one digit primes 2, 3, 5, and 7. Then try to add another digit to the right of these so that the new numbers are also prime. We could have 23, 29, 31, 37, 53, 59, 71, 73, and 79. Now we try to add another digit. We could have 233, 239, 293, 311, 313, 317, 373, 379, 593, 599, 719, 733, 739, and 797. If we keep going with this process we end up with these eight digit numbers 23399339, 29399999, 37337999, 59393339, and 73939133. There are no nine digit prime numbers that start with any of these eight digits so the biggest right-truncatable number is 73939133.</p>

<p><b>About: </b> Interestingly there are 4260 left-truncatable primes but only 83 right-truncatable primes. If you repeatedly remove the first and last digit of a prime number and it stays prime, it is called a left-and-right-truncatable prime. There are 920720315 of those!</p>

<h3>Extension 1</h3>

<p>A left-truncatable prime is a prime number that remains a prime when you successively remove the first digit. E.g. 137 is a prime number, so is 37 and so is 7 so 137 is a left-truncatable prime. The biggest one is 357686312646216567629137. There are eleven 2 digit ones, can you find them all? Can you find more 3 digit ones?</p>

<p><b>Hint: </b> 23 is the first one because 23 and 3 are both prime numbers.</p>

<p><b>Explanation: </b> The two digit left-truncatable primes are: 13, 17, 23, 37, 43, 47, 53, 67, 73, 83, 97</p>
<p>The three digit left-truncatable primes are: 113, 137, 167, 173, 197, 223, 283, 313, 317, 337, 347, 353, 367, 373, 383, 397, 443, 467, 523, 547, 613, 617, 643, 647, 653, 673, 683, 743, 773, 797, 823, 853, 883, 937, 947, 953, 967, 983, 997</p>

<h2> H9 - Shuffling Cards</h2>

<p>If you shuffle a deck of cards properly, it's more than likely that the exact order of the cards you get has never been seen before in the whole history of the universe.</p>

<p><b>Hint: </b> How many arrangements of the 52 cards can we have? Maybe this is too big to start with. Let's try out a smaller number of 3 cards, how many different arrangements can we have? Now try 4 cards?</p>
<p>Can we now use this to get to the 52 cards?</p>

<p><b>Explanation: </b> We want to work out how many different combinations of 52 cards there are. Let us start with thinking about just 3 cards. We could compare this to thinking about the number of ways 3 people could sit in three numbered chairs. Any of the three people could sit on the first chair, then either of the 2 remaining people could sit on the second chair and then there is 1 person left who would have no choice but to sit on the only remaining chair. We can multiply the number of choices for each chair (3×2×1 = 6) to find how many different ways there are for the 3 people to be arranged. It is interesting to note that the pattern here is taking the initial number then multiplying consecutively by the next smallest integer until you reach 1. This process has a name, it is called <strong>Factorial. </strong>The symbol for it is !. e.g. 3! = 6. Generally if you want to find the number of different ways you can rearrange n items, you can find n! = n!×(n - 1)!×(n - 2)!×…×1 The number of ways to shuffle 52 cards is 52! = 52×51×50×…×3×2×1 which is roughly equal to  8×10⁶⁷</p>

<p><b>About: </b> 52! is around 8×10⁶⁷. If someone shuffled a deck of cards once per second since the beginning of the universe (let's say around 14 billion years ago) they would only have shuffled the deck 10¹⁸ times.</p>
<p>Therefore when you shuffle a deck, it is almost certain that you are the first person to play with the cards in exactly that order.</p>

<h3>Extension 1</h3>

<p>Take a deck of 52 cards, shuffle them as much as you can, then try to guess which exact cards will be the top 3 cards (in order). Did you get your guess right? </p>
<p>Now if we assume that there are 1 million people doing exactly this procedure, we would expect around 7 people to guess right.</p>

<p><b>Hint: </b> What is the chance of guessing the top card correctly?</p>

<p><b>Explanation: </b> The chance of guessing the first card is 1 ∕ 52. The chance of then getting the second card right is 1 ∕ 51 and then 1 ∕ 50 for the third card. So the chance of guessing all three correctly is (1 ∕ 52)×(1 ∕ 51)×(1 ∕ 50) = 0.0000075415. Multiply this by the 1000000 people guessing gives you 7.51478.. So you would only expect around 7 people to guess correctly.</p>

<h2> H10 - Square numbers and triangular numbers</h2>

<p>The first six triangular numbers are 1, 3, 6, 10, and 15</p>
<p>The first six square numbers are 1, 4, 9, 16, and 25</p>
<p>Any square number bigger than 1 is the sum of two consecutive triangular numbers.</p>

<p><b>Hint: </b> Triangular numbers can be drawn with dots in the shape of a triangle. Square numbers can be drawn with dots in the shape of a square grid. See if you can work this one out visually first. Can you express it algebraically as well?</p>

<p><b>Explanation: </b> We first show this visually, in the image below you can see that 4 = 1 + 3,  9 = 3 + 6, 16 = 6 + 10, and 25 = 10 + 15. </p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/Square_Numbers_and_Triangular_Numbers_image_0.png" class="Square_Numbers_and_Triangular_Numbers_image_0" /></p>
<p>If we take T = triangular and S = square, then we can draw the S-number as an S-grid of points, the smaller T-number forms the upper T of points, the larger T-number forms the lower T AND the diagonal of points.</p>
<p>These are consecutive triangular numbers making a square.</p>
<p>The side length in points of the bigger T-number is the square root of the S-number. </p>

<p><b>About: </b> The formula for the nᵗʰ triangular number is also exactly equal to the summation 1 + 2 + 3 + … + n and so it is a quick way to add up lists of consecutive numbers! This formula was written down by the Irish monk Dicuil in about 816AD but was possibly already known to the Pythagoreans in the 5th century BC.</p>

<h3>Extension 1</h3>

<p>Find the 250ᵗʰ triangular number.</p>

<p><b>Hint: </b> Starting with a small triangular number might help. Can you use the pattern of triangles and squares to help you? What square could be the sum of the 250ᵗʰ triangular number and another triangular number? Think about the 250ᵗʰ square number and how it relates to the 250ᵗʰ triangular number.</p>

<p><b>Explanation: </b> Let us look at a smaller example first. We could find the 5ᵗʰ triangular number using this square:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/Square_Numbers_and_Triangular_Numbers_image_1.png" class="Square_Numbers_and_Triangular_Numbers_image_1" /></p>
<p>We are looking for the number of purple squares. We can do ½×(5×5 - 5) = 10 to get the pink triangle. And then adding on the 5 squares in the diagonal gives the purple triangle. So we have 15.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/Square_Numbers_and_Triangular_Numbers_image_2.png" class="Square_Numbers_and_Triangular_Numbers_image_2" /></p>
<p>For the 250ᵗʰ triangular number, we are looking for the number of squares in the black "triangle". It will be roughly ½×250×250, except that the diagonal will be included. So we calculate ½×(250×250 - 5) to find the blue triangle and then add 250 on to find the black triangle. The answer is 31375.</p>
<p>We can extend this logic to find a formula for the nth triangular number</p>
<p>½×(n×n - n) + n = ½×(n² +2×n - n) = ½×(n² + n) = ½×n×(n + 1)</p>
<p>Check: ½×250×251 = 31375</p>
<p>Using the formula, we can also see that consecutive triangular numbers add to a square number. Consecutive triangular numbers can be represented as ½×(n - 1)×n and ½×n×(n + 1).</p>
<p>If we add these consecutive triangular numbers and simplify we can find:</p>
<p>½×(n - 1)×n + ½×n×(n + 1)=  ½×((n - 1)×n + n×(n + 1)) = ½×(n² - n + n²  + n) = n² </p>

<h2> HJ - Benford's Law</h2>

<p>When you look at numbers found in real-world data sets, for most sets of numbers the first digit is more often a 1 than any other digit. 2 is a more common first digit than 3, and so on up to 9. In fact, the first digits often follow the same pattern (distribution).</p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/Benford_s_Law_image_0.png" class="Benford_s_Law_image_0" /></p>

<p><b>Hint: </b> Have a look at some data sets that span many orders of magnitude. For example, what are the first digits of: the first 100 prime numbers (or more!), the populations of the countries in Africa, the heights of the tallest buildings in the world?</p>

<p><b>Explanation: </b> Many data sets (for example, populations of countries, heights of buildings, stock prices) or famous sequences (Fibonnacci numbers, prime numbers) are spread over very different scales (orders of magnitude). Many of these big sets of data arise from decreasing power laws. A simple example might be  </p>
<p>y = k×10⁽⁻ᵃˣ⁾ where k, a &gt; 0. Choosing a = 0.1 and k = 1000 gives the following:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/Benford_s_Law_image_1.png" class="Benford_s_Law_image_1" /></p>
<p>Power laws will look like a straight line on semi-log graph paper - where the y-axis is on a log-scale paper. We can show this by rewriting our formula for the power law y = k×10⁽⁻ᵃˣ⁾ = 10ᵇ×10⁽⁻ᵃˣ⁾ = 10⁽⁻ᵃˣ⁺ᵇ⁾ , and then applying a logarithm on both sides: log₁₀(y) = - a×x + b. This is the equation when the y-axis is on a log scale. The same example is shown below:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/Benford_s_Law_image_2.png" class="Benford_s_Law_image_2" /></p>
<p>The horizontal lines represent 1, 2, 3, 4, …, 10, 20, 30, …, 100, 200, 300, … and note they are unevenly spaced on the y axis! The largest spaces are between 1 and 2, between 10 and 20, and between 100 and 200. The smallest spaces are between 9 and 10, 90 and 100.</p>
<p>Try picking random values of x, and reading off corresponding values of y from our (power law) straight line. Because of the spacing of the horizontal lines we see that we are most likely to get a value of y with first digit 1, then we are next likely to get a value of y with a first digit 2, etc. These probabilities are what leads to Benford's Law. </p>

<p><b>About: </b> Benford's Law is used in the real world to check for fraud on big data sets. If they don't follow the law when they should, it is possible they have been falsified!</p>

<h3>Extension 1</h3>

<p>Can you think of which sets of numbers do not obey Benford's law?</p>

<p><b>Hint: </b> The explanation of Benford's law mentioned that the data set typically spans many orders of magnitude.</p>

<p><b>Explanation: </b> Anything that is within a small range, an example would be something normally distributed E.g Measure everyone's height (in metres). Almost all heights would begin with a 1.</p>

<h2> HQ - Lychrel Numbers</h2>

<p>Take a positive integer (whole number). Reverse the digits to get a new number. Add the two numbers together. Repeat this process until you get a palindrome (a number that reads the same forwards and backwards).</p>
<p>Can you find a starting number that doesn't end up at a palindrome? Nobody knows if this is possible.</p>

<p><b>Hint: </b> Pick a positive integer (whole number), e.g. 57. Reverse the digits to get 75. Adding gives 57 +75 = 132. Then reverse this new number and add together. You get 132 + 231 = 353. This is a palindrome as it reads the same forwards as backwards, so we stop. Can you find a number that takes longer to reach a palindrome? </p>

<p><b>Explanation: </b> Some numbers end up in a palindrome after one step, e.g. 243: 243 +342 = 585. Some take a bit longer, e.g. 87: </p>
<p>87 + 78 = 165, </p>
<p>165 +561 = 726, </p>
<p>726 + 627 = 1353, </p>
<p>1353 + 3531 = 4884.</p>
<p>Some numbers take a very long time – 89 takes an unusually large 24 steps (the most of any number under 10,000) to reach the palindrome 8813200023188.</p>
<p>A number is called a Lychrel number if it never reaches a palindrome. No one has proved that a Lychrel number exists. One possibility is 196 - the first billion steps have been carried out by computers and it hasn't reached a palindrome… but this does not prove it never will!</p>

<p><b>About: </b> If you change the base of the problem to binary then 10110 (22 in decimal) is a Lychrel number. The name Lychrel comes from a rough anagram of Wade Van Landingham's girlfriend Cheryl.</p>

<h3>Extension 1</h3>

<p>Can you find different 3-digit numbers that take 1, 2, 3, and 4 steps to become a palindrome?</p>

<p><b>Hint: </b> Most smaller 3-digit numbers take only 1 step to become a palindrome, but try using bigger digits that will mean you have to carry when you add (e.g. 8 + 9 = 17 so you will have to carry the 1).</p>

<p><b>Explanation: </b> There are lots of options, but 122 takes 1 step, 109 takes 2 steps, 199 takes 3 steps and 192 takes 4 steps.</p>

<h2> HK - Collatz Conjecture</h2>

<p>Think of a positive integer (whole number). If it is even, halve it. It if is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1. Repeat the process with your new number and keep going. Stop if you get to the number 1. Nobody knows if a number exists that doesn't end up at 1.</p>

<p><b>Hint: </b> For example, if you choose the number 6 you would get this sequence 6, 3, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1. So it took 8 steps to get to 1. Try some numbers of your own.</p>

<p><b>Explanation: </b> This activity is interesting because it is easy to understand the rules and start generating sequences, but no one knows whether all numbers end up at 1; it is an unsolved problem in mathematics. The longest sequence for a number smaller than 100 is for 97, which takes 118 steps but finally gets to 1. The number just before, 96, only takes 12 steps! Using computers, all numbers up to roughly 2.95×10²⁰ have been checked and they all go to 1.</p>

<p><b>About: </b> The conjecture is named after Lothar Collatz, who introduced the idea in 1937, two years after receiving his doctorate. Many people since Collatz have tried to find a sequence that doesn't go to 1, or to prove that all sequences go to 1 and no one has succeeded. There is a prize of at least $2,000 dollars if you succeed! On the 8th of September 2019, Terence Tao produced a proof, using sampling of numbers, that almost all numbers eventually reach a value that is quite close to 1. Roughly speaking he proved that 99% of starting values greater than 1 quadrillion eventually reach a value below 200. This is a huge step forward for such a difficult problem! </p>

<h3>Extension 1</h3>

<p>What is the biggest number that takes exactly 8 steps to get to 1?</p>

<p><b>Hint: </b> Which type of numbers go very quickly towards 1 because they always follow the halving rule?</p>

<p><b>Explanation: </b> The shortest sequences are the ones where you can always half the numbers. That means they are powers of 2, e.g. 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32 etc. as these numbers "snowball" to 1. 256 gets to 1 to 8 steps, always by halving: 256, 128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1.</p>

<h2> S1 - Fifteen</h2>

<p>This is a game for two players (or a group split into two teams). Take the A and 2 to 9 cards of any suit and place them face up in order. A = 1 in this game. Take it in turns to choose one of the cards and place it in front of you. To win, be the first player to hold exactly three cards that add up to 15. You can have more than three cards, but you only win if three of them make 15.</p>

<p><b>Further instructions: </b> Remember you can't use two numbers to make 15, you can't use four numbers, it must be three numbers. You can have more than three cards in your hand and use only 3 of them. The game is a draw if all the cards have been chosen and nobody can make 15.</p>

<p><b>Strategy Tips: </b> Write down all the combinations of three numbers that add up to 15. How can you be sure that you have found all the combinations? Which numbers appear in 2, 3, and 4 of these combinations?</p>
<p>Think about other games you might have played that this is similar to. Is it an advantage to go first or second?</p>

<p><b>About: </b> This game is interesting because it is the same as the game tic-tac-toe/naughts and crosses. The technical term for this is <em>isomorphic. </em>In mathematics it is often helpful, when faced with a new problem, to relate it to one you already know how to solve.</p>

<h3>Extension 1</h3>

<h2> S2 - Patience</h2>

<p>This is a one player game of patience. Lay out a grid of 8 cards in 2 rows of 4 cards, face up and hold the remaining cards. If you find two cards in the grid that sum to 11 you can put new cards from your hand on top of them. If you find the 3 picture cards (J, Q, and K) you can also put 3 new cards on top. The object of the game is to put down all the cards in your hand. </p>

<p><b>Further instructions: </b> Remove the Jokers before starting. A has a value of 1 in this game. If you manage to play all your cards, the last stage of the game is to pick up pairs of piles of cards whose top cards add up to 11, or three piles whose top cards are J, Q, K. You have won the game if you can pick up all the cards. If you can't put down all your cards, count how many are left</p>

<p><b>Strategy Tips: </b> This game is mostly luck - but you need to think carefully about how many J, Q and K you cover to win the final stage!</p>

<p><b>About: </b> These types of games are often called Patience or Solitaire. Patience because you need a lot of patience to try and win, and Solitaire because you can play them on your own. Although many variations of Patience are down to chance, it is interesting to use mathematics to analyse the probability of winning.</p>

<h3>Extension 1</h3>

<p>A similar game uses 10 cards face up and you have to remove pairs that add up to 13 (A = 1, J = 11, Q = 12, and K=13). The K can be removed on its own. Each time you remove cards you replace them with new ones. The aim is to finish playing all the cards in the deck. </p>
<p>You could make up your own version of this type of game by choosing the number to sum to, how many cards are face up to start with and what to do with the face cards. Can you design a game that can be won about half of the time?</p>

<h2> S3 - Twenty-one</h2>

<p>Players take it in turn to count up, starting from 1 and saying 1, 2, or 3 numbers at a time. Continue counting from where the other player stops. The player who says 21 loses.</p>

<p><b>Further instructions: </b> An example game: P1 = Player 1, P2 = Player 2. </p>
<p>P1: 1,2,3       P2: 4 </p>
<p>P1: 5,6          P2: 7,8,9 </p>
<p>P1: 10           P2: 11,12,13</p>
<p>P1: 14,15,16 P2:17,18,19</p>
<p>P1: 20           P2: 21</p>
<p>Player 1 wins!</p>

<p><b>Strategy Tips: </b> The person who says 20 wins, as they force the next person to say 21. How can you make sure you say 20? Try to work backwards. After you have played several times you might work out who is going to win before you reach 20 - think about how you know this. Can you work out if it is better to go first or second? Can you make sure you always win?</p>

<p><b>About: </b> 21 is a simple version of the set of games, Nim. It is sometimes called a Misère game - meaning a game that you play to lose. It is thought to have originated in China and is first mentioned in European history at the start of the 16ᵗʰ century. The game was originally played with 21 stones, and you have to pick 1, 2, or 3 stones at a time and the loser is the last one to pick a stone.  </p>

<h3>Extension 1</h3>

<p>There are many ways to change this game. You could be allowed to say up to 4 consecutive numbers instead of 3, or change the goal number of 21 to something different, or change the rule so that the player who says 21 is now the winner, not the loser. Can you still work out how to win when the rules are changed? </p>
<p>The original game can be changed to a group of players who play in a circle, starting clockwise. Just for fun you can have new rules that if someone says two numbers in a row, the direction is reversed. If someone says three numbers in a row you skip one person in the circle. The person to say 21 makes up a new rule e.g. "Instead of the number 5 you have to say potato". The game starts again at number 1 but you have to remember the new rule! If anyone makes a mistake you start again at 1. You can play that if someone makes two mistakes they are out of the game. The last person still playing is the winner!</p>

<p>Arrange 9 sticks in 3 rows as shown. Two players take it in turn to remove one or more sticks from a single row. The loser is the person to take the last stick. Can you find a winning strategy?</p>

<p><b>Further instructions: </b> You can remove as many sticks as you like each turn as long as they come from the same row. For example an opening move could be to take all 5 sticks from the bottom row. You must take at least one stick each turn. You are trying to leave just one stick left for your opponent to be forced to take and therefore lose the game.</p>

<p>This is a two player game. Player 1 secretly chooses four cards and puts them in a row face down. Player 2 has seven attempts to guess the suits (clubs, diamonds, hearts, spades) of these cards, in order. Player 2 guesses by laying four cards in a row face up. Player 1 looks at the suits, and tells them how many suits they guessed in the correct position (x), and how many other suits they have guessed correctly but in the wrong position (o). Player 2 uses this information to make a better guess next time.</p>

<p><b>Further instructions: </b> Here is how a game might work:</p>
<p>Player 1 chooses 1) 4 of Hearts, 2) 3 of Clubs, 3) 8 of Spades, 4) 10 of Spades and places them face down.</p>
<p>Player 2 lays down for example: 1) 6 of Hearts, 2) 4 of Spades, 3) J of Diamonds, 4) 3 of Spades.</p>
<p>Player 2 has three correct suits (Heart, Spade and Spade) and two in the correct position - 1) and 4) so Player 1 would say "you have two in the correct position and one in the wrong position", but doesn't say which ones - an easy way to record this would be xxo. Then player 2 would guess again. They might think that it was the last two cards that were perfectly correct, so keep these and guess a different first two. Recording the results on pen and paper will be necessary and would look like this:</p>
<p>HSDS  xxo</p>
<p>CCDS  xoo </p>
<p>Note that it is just the suits we are interested in, not the numbers. Player 1 is not saying which ones are correct, just saying how many are correct. Player 2 keeps guessing until all four are correct. </p>

<p><b>Strategy Tips: </b> For the guesser: Your first guess will be at random but after that you should be using logic to work out what the solution might be. One good strategy for beginners is just change one card at a time, but as you play more you may find a better optimal strategy.</p>
<p>For the setter: Think about whether it is best to have all the same suit, all different, or some the same. </p>

<p><b>About: </b> This game can be played with numbers, letters, symbols or colours as in the popular board game.</p>

<h3>Extension 1</h3>

<p>Try playing the game by having to guess the numbers of the cards - 1 (A) to 10 - instead of the suits. There will be more options so it will be a lot harder. You could even use J, Q, K too.</p>

<h2> S6 - Latin Squares</h2>

<p>Take the 16 J, Q, K and A cards from a pack. Try to put them in a 4 by 4 square so that each rank (J, Q, K, A) and each suit (Clubs, Diamonds, Hearts, Spades) appears only once in each row and column.</p>

<p><b>Further instructions: </b> This could be a one player puzzle or get a group of people to try it together as it is quite tricky! </p>

<p><b>Strategy Tips: </b> Start by ignoring the suits and try to get the ranks in a square so that each rank appears only once in every row and column. </p>

<p><b>About: </b> This puzzle is an example of a Latin square. Interestingly, if the problem had involved 6 ranks of playing cards it would have been impossible. But with 7 ranks it is quite easy to find a solution. Latin squares are used in medical trials to ensure every participant is allocated to each treatment for the same time period to prove which is the best treatment.</p>

<h3>Extension 1</h3>

<p>Creating a square with the same rules but this time include the 10 cards as well so you have a 5 by 4 square.</p>

<h2> S7 - Gomoku</h2>

<p>Start by drawing a square grid of 15 by 15 lines. Two players take it in turns to place a counter on any point where lines cross. The player who gets five of their counters in a straight line wins. The line can be vertical, horizontal or diagonal.</p>

<p><b>Further instructions: </b> This game is traditionally played with black and white counters, but you could use any different counters, or little pieces of paper. You could also draw the grid in pen and then use pencil to mark x or o for each player and then rub them out when you are finished to be able to use the grid again.</p>

<p><b>Strategy Tips: </b> It is very important to be watching your opponents moves as well as trying to make a line of 5 yourself. If your opponent has three in a row with nothing at either end - this is called "open 3" - then it is a good idea to use your turn to block one end. If they manage to get "open 4" you have certainly lost! A good attacking strategy might be to aim for two overlapping lines of open 3s - like a cross - so that it is very hard for your opponent to defend.</p>

<p><b>About: </b> There is a World Championship tournament for Gomuku. Since 2009 it has used the Swap 2 rule to make it a fair game, no matter who starts. There are also championships for computers to play at Gomuku! So people write an artificial intelligence program and their program plays against someone else's program to see who wins. There are also computer vs. human competitions - in 2017 a computer called Yixin beat the world champion human player Rudolf Dupszki 2-0.</p>

<h3>Extension 1</h3>

<p>For advanced players, the first player has a big advantage. This advantage can be removed by starting the game using the "Swap 2" rule. Let's say at the start of the game player one is crosses (x) and player two is circles (o).</p>
<p>Player one begins the game by marking 3 intersections (two with x, and one with o), player two then chooses one of these three options (i) they take crosses, ending their turn (player one becomes circles and it is now their go), (ii) they stay as circles and add one circle as normal, (iii) they add two circles to the board, but then player one now gets to decide whether they want to steal circles. After this, play as normal.  </p>

<h2> S8 - Sim</h2>

<p>Draw six points in a hexagon. Players take turns to draw a straight line between any two points. Each player should use a different colour. Try to avoid making a triangle: the player that completes a triangle with their colour first loses the game.</p>

<p><b>Further instructions: </b> You might want to draw all the possible lines between the points to start with and then colour over them. This would make the game a bit easier to play. If you don't have two different colours you could use solid and dotted lines for the two players. </p>

<p><b>Strategy Tips: </b> Try to make moves in a way that removes options from your opponent. You might want to try and complete triangles that are of mixed colour.</p>

<p><b>About: </b> The Sim pencil game was invented in 1969 by Gustavus Simmons, a cryptographer, who described it in the Journal of Recreational Mathematics. Frank P. Ramsey proved that there always has to be a winner in this game by the "Theorem on Friends and Strangers". He showed that on completing all the edges of the graph, there must be one triangle that is all the same colour.</p>

<h3>Extension 1</h3>

<p>Draw a 5 by 5 grid of dots. Two players take it in turn to colour a dot (use different colours or an x and a +). The winner is the first player to make a square with four of their points. Squares can be tilted as well as straight.</p>

<h2> S9 - Pong Hau K'i</h2>

<p><img alt="" src="images/Pong_Hau_K_i_image_0.png" class="Pong_Hau_K_i_image_0" /></p>
<p>Draw the grid shown with five points and seven connecting lines. Two players place two counters of the same colour/design in the grid as shown.</p>
<p>Decide who will go first. The first player moves one of their pieces to the centre point. Then players take turns moving a counter along a line to an empty point until one player cannot move a counter and loses.</p>

<p><b>Further instructions: </b> If the same moves are repeated three times, you can decide the game is tied. Each time you play, you should change who goes first or swap starting positions (if you were in the top two positions the first time, take the bottom two positions next time).</p>

<p><b>Strategy Tips: </b> Think about whether it is better to go first or second? What is the position you must achieve in order to block the other player?</p>

<p><b>About: </b> Pong Hau K'i is a simple board game from China. It is also a traditional game in Korea, where it is known as Ou-moul-ko-no. Similar games are played in Togo. If both players play perfectly the game should end in a draw.</p>

<h3>Extension 1</h3>

<p><img alt="" src="images/Pong_Hau_K_i_image_1.png" class="Pong_Hau_K_i_image_1" /></p>
<p>This game is called Shisima and is played in Kenya. Two players each need 3 counters of the same colour/design.</p>
<p>Place the counters on three consecutive points on the outside of the octagon, across from each other. There must be an empty point on both ends of each player's set of counters. </p>
<p>Players take turns moving their counters one space along a line. </p>
<p>To win the game, a player must get three of their pieces in a row, including one counter on the centre (shisima). </p>

<h3>Extension 2</h3>

<p><img alt="" src="images/Pong_Hau_K_i_image_2.png" class="Pong_Hau_K_i_image_2" /></p>
<p>Two players each need 3 counters of the same colour/design. Take it in turns to add one counter to the grid until all six counters have been placed. Then players take turns moving a counter to an empty space until one player has managed to get three of their counters in a row.</p>

<h2> S10 - Stop or Dare</h2>

<p>This is a game for two or three players. Shuffle the deck and place it face down. The first player turns over the top card and continues turning over cards, adding together the value of each card, until they decide to stop and record their score. J = 11 and Q = 12.</p>
<p>If an A or a K is turned over, no points are scored at all and the turn is finished.</p>
<p>Players take turns until someone reaches 100 or more - this player is the winner.</p>

<p><b>Further instructions: </b> If the cards are all turned over before the target is reached, just reshuffle the pack and continue. </p>

<p><b>Strategy Tips: </b> Try and keep count of how many K and A cards have come up already. This could change how daring you are feeling. If someone else is close to 100 it might be best to turn over more cards than you would normally.</p>

<p><b>About: </b> This game can also be played with Dice and is sometimes called Pig. There are one and two dice versions, and even a version where you can choose how many dice to throw rather than how many times to throw a set number of dice.</p>

<h3>Extension 1</h3>

<p>You could try changing the target number, or changing how many cards wipe out your score for that turn. You could also try having K as resetting your <strong>entire</strong> score to zero to make it more daring.</p>

<h2> SJ - Twenty-four</h2>

<p>Remove the 10, J, Q, K, and Joker cards from the deck. Shuffle the rest and deal four cards face up on the table so that every player can see them. Each player attempts to make the number 24 silently using all four numbers (A count as 1), and as many operations +, −, × and ÷ and brackets () as needed. The first person to give an answer with an explanation wins and keeps the 4 cards. Keep playing until there are no cards left.</p>

<p><b>Further instructions: </b> This is a game for two or more players. </p>
<p>A few combinations might be impossible. In this case, put the cards back and shuffle again to choose another 4. </p>

<p><b>Strategy Tips: </b> Think of the factors of 24 to cover i.e, 1×24, 2×12, 3×8, and 4×6. If you have either of the factors in your list, say 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, …  use the remaining numbers to make the other number, or use your numbers to create combinations.</p>

<p><b>About: </b> The number 24 is used because it has so many factors. However, an analysis of all the possible combinations of 4 cards shows that the number 2 would have been the best target number! 99.19% of the combinations could be solved, compared to 80.20% for 24. If you are allowed to use factorials (e.g. 3! = 3×2×1 = 6), then you can solve many more combinations for 24.</p>

<h3>Extension 1</h3>

<p>You can play this game like Snap, with 2 or 4 players. Deal the cards (without the 10, J, Q, K, or Jokers) equally to all players. For two players, on the count of three, they each turn over the top two cards from their pile. For four players, they each just turn over one card. Everyone tries to make 24 using all four cards. The first person to do so takes the cards and puts them at the bottom of their pile. Play continues until one player has run out of cards - then the player with the most cards is the winner.</p>

<h2> SQ - Card Sums</h2>

<p>Remove the 10, J, Q, K, and Joker cards and shuffle the rest of the pack.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/Card_Sums_image_0.png" class="Card_Sums_image_0" /></p>
<p>Any number of players can play. Deal 6 cards face up on a table. Everyone has 1 minute to decide how to set them out in the layout above to make the biggest total of the two multiplications. A counts as 1. The player with the highest score wins.</p>

<p><b>Further instructions: </b> It might help if everyone has pen and paper. After one minute, everyone says their highest total. The person who says the highest number explains how they came to that number, by arranging the cards. If they are correct they win a point, if incorrect, the person with the next highest total attempts to justify their answer. If two people have the same answer they get a point each.</p>

<p><b>Strategy Tips: </b> Think about where it is going to be best to place the biggest numbers.</p>

<p><b>About: </b> These games feature in Andrew Jeffrey's Leader of the Pack book - which has 52 games and activities to do with a deck of cards. There is a perfect strategy to the main game. </p>

<h3>Extension 1</h3>

<p>With the J, Q, K, and Joker cards removed, deal 4 cards to each player. Each player has to make two fractions with their cards which can be added, subtracted, multiplied or divided to try to make the answer as close to 1 as possible. Anyone who can make 1 exactly gets 2 points. If no one can make 1 then the closest to 1 gets 1 point.</p>

<h2> SK - WinTwoThreeFour</h2>

<p>Remove the 10, J, Q, K, and Jokers. Deal each player 9 cards. Players secretly arrange their cards to make a 4-digit number, a 3-digit number and a 2-digit number. All at once, the players show their three numbers.</p>
<p>The biggest 2-digit number gets 2 points, biggest 3-digit gets 3 points, biggest 4-digit gets 4 points. If there is a tie then the points are split between the players.</p>

<p><b>Further instructions: </b> You could play a certain number of rounds or play until a player gets to a certain score, e.g. 25.</p>

<p><b>Strategy Tips: </b> It is tempting to focus on making your 4 digit number as big as possible, but maybe everyone else is trying to do this too! It is important to watch how your opponents are playing and try and adapt your strategy to beat them.</p>

<p><b>About: </b> This game featured in Andrew Jeffrey's Leader of the Pack book - which has 52 games and activities to do with a deck of cards. It is simple to understand the rules but very interesting to try and find a strategy to win.</p>

<h3>Extension 1</h3>

<p>Try playing this so that the smallest 2-digit number gets 2 points, smallest 3-digit number gets 3 points and smallest 4-digit number gets 4 points. </p>
