  "main_version": {
    "statement": "<p>Think of a positive integer (whole number). If it is even, halve it. It if is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1. Repeat the process with your new number and keep going. Stop if you get to the number 1. Nobody knows if a number exists that doesn't end up at 1.</p>",
    "hint": "<p>For example, if you choose the number 6 you would get this sequence 6, 3, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1. So it took 8 steps to get to 1. Try some numbers of your own.</p>",
    "explanation": "<p>This activity is interesting because it is easy to understand the rules and start generating sequences, but no one knows whether all numbers end up at 1; it is an unsolved problem in mathematics. The longest sequence for a number smaller than 100 is for 97, which takes 118 steps but finally gets to 1. The number just before, 96, only takes 12 steps! Using computers, all numbers up to roughly 2.95\u00d710\u00b2\u2070 have been checked and they all go to 1.</p>"
  },
  "extension_1": {
    "statement": "<p>What is the biggest number that takes exactly 8 steps to get to 1?</p>",
    "hint": "<p>Which type of numbers go very quickly towards 1 because they always follow the halving rule?</p>",
    "correct_answer": "256",
    "explanation": "<p>The shortest sequences are the ones where you can always half the numbers. That means they are powers of 2, e.g. 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32 etc. as these numbers \"snowball\" to 1. 256 gets to 1 to 8 steps, always by halving: 256, 128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1.</p>"

  "additional_information": {
    "about": "<p>The conjecture is named after Lothar Collatz, who introduced the idea in 1937, two years after receiving his doctorate. Many people since Collatz have tried to find a sequence that doesn't go to 1, or to prove that all sequences go to 1 and no one has succeeded. There is a prize of at least $2,000 dollars if you succeed! On the 8th of September 2019, Terence Tao produced a proof, using sampling of numbers, that almost all numbers eventually reach a value that is quite close to 1. Roughly speaking he proved that 99% of starting values greater than 1 quadrillion eventually reach a value below 200. This is a huge step forward for such a difficult problem! </p>",
